       "'Tirumala. No wonder people spend hours and hours in the queue, just to get a glimpse of Lord Venkateshwara for just a couple of seconds. Faith can do wonders, and the thousands and thousands of devotees, of all ages prove this every day, queuing up to get the blessing of lord Venkateshwara. The moment you enter through the doors, it\\'s a blissful experience, some sort of positive vibes takes over and the chant of Govinda Govinda just lets one forget their tiredness and feel energized. I am visited number of times and every time I feel it\\'s I am first time visit, with plan or with out plan visit tirumala. Everything is good only happen. In tirumala there is free buses is available to reach temple to rooms & cottages and seeing the beauty of tirumala in night time also. One of most femous temple in india .in this temple anytime crowd .high in weekendays .300 ruppess ticket want bookthrough online ttd website and to go.2 to 3 hours darshan completed heavy crowd 5 to 6 hours in queline .free darshan tokens also available in online .suprabhataseva archana thomala seva. abisheka tickets who gets he is lucky .it is getting by dip lottery system every month announced to register ttd app .login and I\\'d proof want to submitted.vip break darshan 500 ruppess by letter .accomodation also online .very clean temple .Balaji God is also very powerful.in every town .City .Balaji temple is there .but only in tirumala lord Venkateswara in india .that place mahimma.vushnu padam varahaswamy temple must visit.swamy pushkarani holy bath is very good .richest God .ananthapadmanaba swamy tirumala venteswara swamy two . No words striking in my mind to describe the Kali Yuga daivam divinity and peace we get here everytime of visit, spending hours of time seems to be just like fraction of seconds First off, to get to Tirumala from Tirupati or the other way, there is no free transportation. It will cost 90rs one-way on buses run by TTD or APSRTC from most anywhere in Tirupati. Also to visit any of the tourist spots like Aakasha ganga, Shilathoranam, Srivari paadalu which are a few kms apart on Tirumala hill, there is no free transport. There are bus services that charge Rs.120 per person with which you can hop-on/hop-off all day from one place to another. However, the sign boards showing directions on Tirumala hill is not very useful, and there are no maps or information desks despite this being such a rich temple, making it hard to find your way if you are a first timer. I visited the temple for Balaji darshan in second week of Jan 2023. It took about 2hrs50mins from the time I got into the 300/- special darshan entrance to the time I exited the temple after darshan of less than 5 seconds. Darshan tip for first-timer: When you go into the inner-most hall and before the last left turn, the queue splits into two with a railing in between. Just make sure you stay in the queue on the right side with which you will be able to see Balaji directly in front without any obstruction from people in the other queue if you ended up going in the queue on the left side. Lord balaji\\'s darshan Fir a second Unique When i went unbelievable sceneries with fog, rain, Tirumala is so clean Had laddu prasadam Went there for my son’s mundan. We went on a weekday, and still it was crowded. Our wait time was 3 hours. We did online booking and special Darshan. But was very satisfied with the Darshan. Crowd was little out of control. We went early in the morning for darshan. We purchased tickets on the website for the early morning darshan. Expensive but was worth it as we had elderly and kids in our group. As many mentioned, we cannot spend too much time inside the temple, mainly due to the many people in line.... so remember to keep your eyes open and not blink : ) We got to spend a few minutes after exiting the main temple which gave us an opportunity to soak in the energy of the temple. Felt the process was more transparent (although a bit more expensive) than when we visited 10 years ago. Even though the temple is earning crores of rupees from the Devotees as donation. The Devotees are at the mercy of the administration and Management. It is my personal feeling that the darshan should be free and obstacle free for all the devotees of God and should be equally treated. This temple has taken the shape of a Corporate company.  The devotees are differentiated based on the monetary power no clarity in accommodation and darshan booking it\\'s not easy to get darshan which is very wrong the corporatisation has made easy darshan for Rich and difficult for the poor which needs to be addressed immediately. Devotees are compelled to be in queue for 36-36 hours to get darshan Although the facilities have been created immensely by the previous govt but now the system of darshan is pathetic. The management is quite biased towards prioritising the darshan. Even after clearly defined line for defence, the forms are not being issued by the staff and making chaos. After filling up the form and getting special entry ticket, there is no priority given as such. It took around 6 hours for darshan. The quota of the accomodation and darshan are not being opened well in time. All defence personnel whether senior officer or Sepoy, all are being treated at par. There should be some sanctity of rank if it is being differentiated as defence line. One of my colleague came from UP after spending so much and he tried to get darshan for two days but not done and went back without darshan with his family even though he shown his identity being a Civil Judge of High Court, it clearly shows the ignorance and miss management of the staff. I recommend the staff posted there should be mixed of police, para military forces as well as defence personnel for maintaining transparency in the system. Jai Govinda. Is there any process for foreigners to visit temple? Is so, then how? I know there is a NRI quota for daily Darshan. is it for foreigners also? Thank you! Proud to be an Hindu, every religion in our country trust lord Venkateshwara swamy. As we trust Allah,Jesus. A very positive vibration is created once we see our beloved swamy. Swamy just protect us from our evil things and deadly diseases. Govinda Govinda The powerful positive vibrations in the temple leave one dump when entering the temple. Though one gets a glimpse of the Lord for a few seconds, sure of getting rejuvenated. Hats off to the Temple Staff who controls the massive crowd in a systematic way without any stampede. Om Namo Bhagwate Vashudevay..... One of the richest temple in world, best crowd management service, mesmerizing location, thousands of people with their faith, world famous Laddu and anna prasadm, Aastha and bishwash is above all thoughts. A must visit place. Plan properly to get there in advance. All issues will be very easy. Jai Govinda... We visited on a working day (Wednesday) taking a package tour from Chennai as it includes paid darshan tickets also. The rush was less than expected. It took 2 hours from entry gate to darshan. We felt the energy radiating from Lord Venkateswara. So, I recommend to visit this place in middle of the week to avoid huge rush. One cannot miss this pilgrimage in lifetime must visit place. Cannot describe in words. You feel full of positive energy when u see Lord Venkateswara, i had book for Rs 300/- special Dharshan for 8pm on November was near the entry gate by 6pm, it took 2 hrs to enter the scanning centre, crowded , after scanning we were guided to a waiting cell it took another 1.5 hrs to move from the cell to the temple by 10.45 pm we were out from the temple.  Tips  No plastic bottles allowed while entering the hills they check in Sapthagiri Check Point, if you have closed or opened plastic bottles they just throw it, they say Tirumala is fully plastic free policy  Please don’t take kids with u it become very difficult for parents to handle kids as the kids they get frustrated with crowd and starts crying. It become difficult for parents to handle small children and take God’s blessings  When u enter inside the temple keep all eye on Lord Venkatramana as the guard will just push you & will not allow u to stand in front of God please don’t miss the glance of God  If you are travelling by car please park your car in Varaha swami parking lot near Varaha temple which is a very easy excess to the temple, where u can visit brother Lord Varaha swami and from there to lord Venkataramana & better keep your mobile phone, chapels and other valuable belongings inside the car as it become very difficult to fetch from the temple once you finish the Darshana, you have to walk a long way to get your belongings back.  Trust me all your wishes will be fulfilled Lord Venkatraman Govinda Govinda 🙏🏻 Worst of worst experience. Don\\'t go with family. The temple maintainers are creating or giving buildup that lot of people are coming. Actually the maintainance is not good at all. They ensure for all atleast it take 3 hours for darshan and darshan not more than 10secs if you are lucky. Stop going let them create a process where darshan can be done in half an hour. Visiting Tirumala will be always a pleasant experience that just can\\'t be explained in words. We recently had a short trip to Tirumala. I and my wife both had a free darshan along with my child as she is below one year, there will be a separate queue for it called \"Supadham\" for the couples carrying a child. We completed darshan in less than 2 hours and it is a pleasant one. We managed to get a room only for reaching Tirumala as online room bookings are completed for us. However, it is suggested to book a room online only. It\\'s one of the best temples I have ever visited in lifetime. The divinity and the peace at the temple pulls me towards it everytime. The temple is very pure with greenary everywhere. The temple is also known for it\\'s cleanliness. The authorities of the temple are so vigilant and always keep an eye on it. The temple is renowned and prominent for it\\'s treasure and donations that comes everyday making it the richest temple in the world. The shrine is very famous across the country and globe. Although the area is hot, humid and some water crunches, it\\'s still pilgrims wish to visit the temple once in lifetime. Located down in the south, the temple is quite crowded usually and why not, it\\'s located in the second most populous country afterall. Temple is a must visit in October during Dussehra, one can witness grand celebrations. On and all, one won\\'t be disappointed if they visit the temple. There are also good sightseeing spots nearby where you can explore the city.  - Siri. We visited Tirumala on Sep 7th,2022 after 3 years. The 300/- darshan took 4.5 hours long(11-00am to 3:30 pm)and we will miss a lot of other activities like Laddu pick-up.lunch,checkout and boarding train/flight if we didn\\'t plan well. The accommodation also once we scanned at CRO, you have to complete check-in process at the respective allocated Rest house within 2 (allocation of room received on your registered mobile numbers). In case,If your online slot timings are incorrect and also check-in room didn\\'t happen with the mentioned time at the rest house, your room allocation will be blocked by the system. Even the tonsure at all rest houses will not be available, sometimes it may take time to complete the tonsure process(due to duty change or server crashes). The plastic bottles are banned and they are throwing into trash at the Alipiri check point (eventhough someone carrying the bottles to Tirumala by hiding them). You can carry your steel bottle and fill it up or buy glass bottles for 60/-(30/- refund, if you return empty glass bottle) . Plan your activities properly. Well organized, long queues and wonderful darshan. Time itself stands by as spirituality takes over our flesh and bones and the chants of God Govinda spur us to be nice and happy. All pilgrims are rewarded with prasad. People of myriad places come together in a show of unity and pomp before the lord. Very nice place on the top of the Saptagiri Mountains. With people having lot of faith in the Lord Balaji calm and quiet place if you ho with full plan very nice stay We went there during the Deepawali time of 2021 via Renuguntta Rly Stn. It was a wonderful journey. Decent hotel accommodations through Trust were provided to us. Well-organized protocols are there for darshan, prasad and meal as well. It was impressive. The area was cleaned and well organised due to the occasion of Deepawali. After darshan, prasad means laddu was fabulous. It was a great pleasure and life moment for me and my family. We are thankful to the TTD management. Thanks. We visited temple on our holiday to India from UK. We got Rs. 300 special darshan tickets and were advised that darshan will be done in 2 hours time. We are family of 4. We reached Tirumala at 2 pm on 08/08/22 and were shown the line to join, joined line around 2:30 pm. There were checks at 4 points along the line which I feel is pointless, if you have done checks properly once, there is no need for further checking. All devotees were sent to compartments inorder to wait for the Darshan. There were no facilities for water or any snacks in the compartments, it used to be lot different 4-5 years back (where in devotees have option to buy any refreshments while waiting in the compartment). No one has a clue how long we need to wait in the compartments. When they opened the doors of compartments they were opening on both sides which created more chaos, small children were crying on top of their voice. There were 2 break darshans (entry for VIP\\'s by stopping other devotees) during our wait in the compartment. Devotees were treated like nothing and there is no operational management of the queues, most of the employees/volunteers doesn\\'t have a clue. Even in the digital age there is no option to pay via phonepay/google pay or card payments in the queue. We completed our darshan after 4 hours in the queue, thought we will have lunch after darshan thinking it will take close to 2 hours. We were without lunch or any refreshments for 4 hours. Once we come out of queue collecting Laddu\\'s is one more challenge. Based on my experience, I thought TTD committee is making tough for devotees to have smooth darshan. Have you Heard about The King Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj now who\\'s photos,idols, and stickers are not allowed for tirupati Balaji devasthan I am not telling about God tirupati Balaji but you should respect the king who fought for whole nation.Becuase of that king the god is in the temple plzz don\\'t do that if appear will have to take strict action against them. Blessed Day - Thursday - 28-July-2022  Started from Bangalore to Holy Pilgrimage Tirumala at 11:00 AM. Took Hoskote, Kolar, Mulbagal, Palamner, Chittor, Pakala - Tirupathi Road. As we started little late in the morning, we had a lot of traffic until KR Puram Bridge. Post that the road was good and we observed less traffic. Even though it was rainy season it didn’t rain throughout the journey. Stopped at Nandi Upachar hotel - Had lunch there at around 2:00 PM. (I don’t rate this hotel 5* but average food.) Continued the journey and reached Tirupathi (foothill) at around 4:30 PM. At Tirupathi we first went to Kapilatirtham (Kapila Theertham is a famous Saivite Temple and Theertham, located at Tirupati in the Tirupati District of Andhra Pradesh, India. The idol is believed to be installed by Kapila Muni and hence Lord Siva here is referred to as Kapileswara.) We need to park the car outside and walk a bit, parking fees 50rs. The water falls is a scenic beauty and water is very pure, its is very nice to take bath there. There are rooms available for changing clothes in case necessary. Post bath we had darshan of Lord Shiva, Lord Venugopal, Lakshminarayan, Hanuman, Kamakshi, Ganpati, Bhairav, Navagraha, etc at this place. After this we carried on to visit Padmavathi Temple (Padmavathi Temple is the temple dedicated to Goddess Padmavathi or Alamelumanga, the consort of Lord Venkateswara. The temple is situated in Tiruchanur, Tirupati in Tirupati district of Andhra Pradesh, India.) Here there is special darshan available for 20/100 Rs. We took the 100Rs one and had great darshan of Devi Padmavathi.(Timings - 7–11:30am, 12:30–6pm, 7–9pm). After this we started to Tirumala via Alipiri. Here there will be checking - we need to unpack everything from the car for scanning, no plastic zone starts here. After checking we may proceed to Tirumala. We shouldn’t speed on this road, there are fines for speeding on this road. Road was poorly lit but clean and neat. We checked into the Arya Vysya Guest house. Room rent ~2000 for AC rooms, this is available only though letter from Donors.  Friday - 29-July-2022  Woke up early in the morning. There are many coffee shops nearby, visited one of them and had coffee. Just beside the guest house there is small hotel (Don’t expect very nice food in any of the hotels, best is to have food at any Matt\\'s - they serve awesome food for free.) You are free to contribute anything to this noble cause. We had Darshan at 10:00AM. I had booked 300rs special darshan ticket. Parents/relatives had booked for Kalyanaotsava. Special Darshan took me 1hour. We didn’t have to sit or wait in any of the waiting rooms, it was always moving queue. Had some pushing/pulling at main entrance and near the Garba Gudi - rest of the time it was smooth queue. Had wonderful darshan of Lord Venkateshwara - He is standing tall and beautiful.. After this they give laddu prasadam at the temple (small). There are other deities as well inside the temple along with Vimana Venkateshwara (decorated with silver outline). In fact they say before visiting Lord Venkateshwara we should visit Varahaswamy temple which is beside the main temple, we didn’t do that however visited it later next day. Parents/relatives took 5+ hours to complete the Kalyanotsava Darshan. There is Srivari Hundi inside the temple where we can give the offerings to Lord. Had food at the same restaurant (Beside guest house) at around 3:00 PM. I was waiting for Parents/relatives for lunch, however they had it without me at Sri Venkateshwara Annapradada Mantap and come. Relaxed for some time at the guest house and then we took the car to see places around Tirumala. First we visited Akashaganga (The blissful waterfalls of Akasa Ganga is one of the most sacred waterfronts in India and lies at the foothills of Venkatadri Tirumala. Visited by everyone who comes to seek the blessings of Lord Venkateshwara, the presiding deity of the city, the waterfall provides water for the Lord\\'s bath as well.) We can take bath here as well. After this we visited HathiRam temple (Hathiram Bhavaji or Hathiram Baba or Hathiram Bairagi was a saint from Dalpatpur Uparhar, Maya, Ayodhya who visited Tirumala around 1500 CE on a pilgrimage and became a devotee of Lord Venkateswara. He settled there by setting up an ashram near the temple. ) Seems like Lord Venkateshwara and HathiRam played Pachis at together. There is also Hanuman temple at this place. They give katta-meeta (sour-sweet) leaves at this place as prasad. After this we visited Papa-Vinasanam (It is supposed to cleanse us and remove all the sins). After this we came back to the guest house. We had prasad for Dinner at Ahobalam Matt. Rest for the day.  Saturday - 30-July-2022  Woke up in the morning. Had breakfast at the hotel nearby and started to go downhill to visit Kalahasthi. Visited Kalahasthi (Srikalahasti, derives its name from the combination of the Sanskrit words Sri (spider), Kala (snake) and Hasti (elephant), which once worshipped the Shiva Linga here and attained Moksha.) There are special darshan tickets available for 50Rs. If we want to perform any pooja here like Rahu-Ketu pooja and all it is recommended not to visit any other place after this pooja, we have to go back home. So we had just casual visit of the temple. There is one temple inside this place which is like a guha and supposed to be very good. Due to heavy rush we couldn’t do this darshan. After this darshan we had an unfortunate event. We had parked the vehicle at Saravana Bhavan for Lunch at around 1:00, after this by mistake I left the key inside the car and car got locked :(. We had to remove the rubber beading of the glass and open the door and went to Mahindra showroom which is in the outskirts of Tirupati to get this fixed. It was almost evening by the time we completed this herculean task. Back to Tirumala and rest for the day. We had planned to visit Kalyana Venkatarama temple, Govinda Raju temple but could not visit them in Tirupathi due to the unfortunate event. As we had some time in the evening went to Varahaswamy temple and had a great Darshan. Luckily there were less crowd when we went so had smooth Darshan.  Sunday - 31-July-2022  Another blessed day. We didn’t have anything planned for this day so was mostly free time. Woke up little late and roamed around the Lord Venkateshwara temple for some time, its actually wonderful place just being there itself is a great feeling. Lunch and breakfast at Matt only. At around 4:00 PM went to see Sila Thoranam which is around 2-3 KM from the temple. (Natural Arch, Tirumala hills, a notified National Geo-heritage Monumen is a distinctive geological feature 1 km (0.6 mi) north of the Tirumala hills temple, near the Chakra Teertham in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The arch is also called Silathoranam (శిలాతోరణం) in the local language (Telugu language: sila means ‘rock’ and thoranam means a garland strung over a threshold, connecting two vertical columns or an ‘arch’ as in this case). The arch measures 8 m (26.2 ft) in width and 3 m (9.8 ft) in height, and is naturally formed in the quartzites of Cuddapah Supergroup of Middle to Upper Proterozoic (1600 to 570 Ma) due to natural erosive forces.) Just beside the main temple there is another temple of Krishna, Hanuman, Hathi Ram and other deities - nice place but no crowd at all - not sure why people don’t visit here. After this back to the guest house and rest for the day. Actually from this day on wards there was preparations for All India Vishnu Sahasranam Federation (AIVSF) functions. I didn’t go there on this day, had rest at the Guest House.  Monday - 1-Aug-2022  Got up early in the morning, this was the day from when All India Vishnu Sahasranam Federation functions started. There was chanting for 108 times in the Asthana Mantapam. Attended this function briefly until 10:30, luckily as my Peddamma was one of the main persons in this team I got a chance to sit beside the deity to perform pooja and give Harathi. This day we had Darshan at 12:00 - special entry 300Rs Darshan. Had breakfast in the morning at hotel and went inside temple premises by around 10:30AM. Actually there are multiple places where entry for 300Rs Darshan, this time I took the longer one. The best option is to go towards left side of the temple (Left if you stand in front of the Gopuram) and take left again (This is the place where special darshan like Kalyanotsava and others are queued). This is a shorter trip for 300Rs Darshan. This time because of the queue/rush it took around 2 and half hours for Darshan. Lunch was served at AIVSF - delicious and absolutely fantastic food. After Darshan we roamed around the temple and participated in chanting for Vishnu Sahasranam. There is one high start restaurant in Tirumala called Sarangi - Near Museum - Food taste was awesome when we had been there in 2020 however now taste has deteriorated.  Tuesday - 2-Aug-2022  Was relaxed day, went to AIVSF for some time, they completed 108 rounds of chanting and we had Maha Mangalaharathi followed by veda parayanam. Breakfast was served hot here (Upma). After this came back to room and packed everything to return to Bangalore. Started at around 1:00 PM - Took Chittor - Mulbagal - Kolar - Bangalore road. Ate lunch at another Nandi Upachar. Reaching until KR Puram was very fast, from KR Puram to reach home it took long time. Reached Bangalore at 8:00 PM. Don\\'t get me wrong it is a lovely temple and is a very fine place. But I don\\'t like the way the temple is handled, devotees are treated like cattle. We are made to go through 6-7 rounds of security checks and we are made to wait for hours even without any information on when we will be allowed to go. I went yesterday (10.07.22) in the 300 ruppees darshan and after waiting for 3 hours and having a nice darshan to be honest I was made to wait for half an hour along with at least 2000 people because the didn\\'t organise it properly making a common entry and exit for the temple and holding people so that people can go inside with a disproportionate wait time. The wait was painful and no way to treat devotees. Children and senior citizens were feeling claustrophobic and tbh even I was. The wait could have been completely avoided if the administration planned things better saving the time of people and saving them from the anxiety and irritation of waiting without cause. Blessed divine blissful well organised near clean  cant wait to be back  evrn long wait in queues doent bother u as vibratins are beautiful I went for a darshan on 23.06.22 on Rs. 300/- ticket pre booked in advance. They literally treated us like buffalos. 1. there are waiting rooms, but still they made us to stand in ques for nearly 3 hours. The waiting room is utilized for just half an hour. 2. There are clear four lanes for having lord darshan when you reach the lord. Then why they dump you inside the temple from all directions and thus create a herd of pilgrims in the temple. For entering the temple you have to squeeze and get in and the same for exit also. What is that they want to achieve. Can they not make a four lane Q from temple entrance. Or at least they can stop dumping from all directions. They don\\'t treat you like a pilgrim and they treat you as buffalos.  Will the TTD or the Government officials take necessary steps to implement a better Q management and try to treat pilgrims as pilgrims.  if no proper action is initiated, the temple will face stampede deaths soon. Only Lord Venkateshwara has to save the pilgrims. It\\'s a peaceful place to with family and friends. we can enjoy the trip for two days on the hills . The premises are very neat and tidy . we can enjoy the nature and forest . Trip was not good. Padmavati temple outside premises is dirty, full of tiny huts/shops, people sleeping on the floor, sewage on the road. Bus to tirumala not in good condition, all available bus to tirumala are very old. The way bus driver driving, you have to pray he doesn\\'t cause accident on Ghat road.  After paying 300/- sheeghra darshan, we waited under scorch sun to get into the queue complex. Everyone treated like cattle by queue complex security. There is lot of push in the queue, everyone leans on everyone else. Any day stampede can be possible. When reached main temple complex, it is 3 hrs already and we were very exhausted standing and slow moving queue.  Finally I don\\'t know what I saw inside main temple complex. Security inside the queue pulled me aside by the time I can see the \\'lord venkateswara\\'.  Overall very bad experience. Very big and very old hindu temple of lord Vankatesha, so many peoples are visit every day and get blessings of god Tirupati Balaji is my all time favorite. However, the trip I had recently was so disappointing. These people in orange sarees literally pull and push kids with both their hands (inside garbha gudi and out side it). My daughter was about to fall.  What if kids go lost in that crowd? Is this the way to do sevas in temple?  The ladies in orange sarees must be trained properly. They must be kind and gentle towards kids. It is foolish to give review for a temple. One goes there for worship . Hence once you are blessed with Darshan , it is only blessings. With all respect to LORD BALAJI.. NEVER EVER VISIT THIS TEMPLE.. TTD has just making money Pujaris are rats You cannot even have a proper look at the BALAJI As usual the temple is great. They have improved a lot. Good to see that. We had a good darshan, as near as possible (thru god\\'s help). Waiting time was about an hour. We were out by 7 am. Tip - DO NOT ask for any directions with the orange saree clad volunteers. They are dumb and useless. They have no clue abt the temple. Ask the security of police who are wearing khakee dress. Our people need to learn a lot. Many Indians are bad travelers. At the Laddu counter, people sit on the steps and start eating, throwing pieces around. Its a prasadam, should not be walked on it. . . I went to Tirumala by walk through Alipiri route on 19/03/2022. I got surgery in my legs with 18 stitches some years back and I can comfortable walking only with shoes. So after checking with rules and security persons it was clear sign to wear and no restriction for slippers while you climb through footpath. It\\'s completely one\\'s own wish. But few fellow devotees keep questioning me for wearing a shoe in the foot path and few idiots infact try to beat me. These insane people should learn how to behave and for what to raise voice. But without telling the reason (my health issue) why I came with shoe, I stood firm and gave everyone a strong reply to them. Please educate people who go by foot path that it\\'s their wish to wear or not to wear slippers and there is no such restriction and also not to fight with someone who come with slippers. I lost my pleasant mind for that day because of this incident. I respect those who come with barefoot, but life is not same for everyone. Grow up and also educate your circle on this. It\\'s my request! Being devotional is nice but that quality should be there without losing the Humanity. We visit the temple quite often, at times 4 times a year. This trip felt special, well organised darshan, great crowd management and surprisingly courteous volunteers. Morning darshan is free from crowed, I booked tickets only and I got darshan in 10 minutes, I don\\'t know Book your darshan tickets in advance. Only you have darshan tickets are allowed to Tirumala from Alpiri. Take VIP Morning Break Darshan, (paid or VIP) if you can, as u will get to go inside the Sanctum Santorum Even lock down didn\\'t stop darshan we were not allowed in Tirupati temple as maharastra enterent were restricted without antigent test. But down blow at the Adobe od the devi mata paramavati temple we found refuge and love as we got vip entry in the holy temple Very worst experience in 13/11/21 food not good after not good communication not give dinner this people talk very harder tirumala go and return to chennai very solwly driving 20 to Sum time 60 speed today is very bad experience very disappointed in ap tourism luggage and foodwar locker not provided than not hair removing place go come are hair remove asked excess 100rs money tirumala packages include to all why not provided please consider ap tourism are public sorry to say this in MI bad experience They have made the place like heaven.A must visit for everyone onnce in life. Management cleanliness and taking care of place everything is perfect. This place is always flooded with people still very beautifully managed . Clean and very organized. They feed to all who want to have food for free and almost most of the hrs .all are accommodated and every one gets darahan and prasad .they handle about a lakh people on an average and they keep improving the infrastructure to make it more and more people friendly.  TTD which is one of the richest temple should invest in Tirupati town infra , especially closed drainage Are remote car keys allowed in Tirumala temple ? I am visiting soon again Tirumala along with my family . Recently i have visited Tirumala all thing are good if you did darshan ticket online but no care/protocol fot corona corona case rising at Ranigunta  We get Balaji darshan quiclly @ its is amazing Hello everyone, please don’t visit Tirumala without booking 300rs ONLINE DARSHANA TICKET.  We visited on 30th July 2021  TTD people will stop you on Govindrajpatna, you cannot go by bus and steps also for Tirumala without online Darshana ticket.  Alpiri steps is closed, only Sri vari mettu is open for ticket booked people , I visited with family , we didn’t booked darshana ticket, we thought of going by steps , but now due to pandemic from April 25th 2021 , people are not allowed to Tirumala without Darshan ticket .  Those who booked ticket can go by bus or private transportation and Sri vari mettu. Without Darshana ticket people cannot go to tirumala. TTD will stop people in all ways to enter tirumala.  We roamed in tirupati ( Govindrajpatna) , people can visit every temple ( kapil thirtham, alemelu mangarpuram, srinivas mangarpuram, kalahasthi) . We return back to Mysore after visiting this temples.  Don’t buy fake luddu.  People will offer you 100rs per luddu, they will say it from Tirumala, please don’t buy this instead of order to your home from TTD website.  Thank you What can I say except Govinda Govinda It is always crowded and lots of devotees visit here for darshan of Lord Tirupati. You can have special darshan after paying some extra fees but still it will take minimum 2 hours to see Lord Tirupati. have been to tirumala temple earlier but never faced such bad and rude people in control. no sense of respect or care for senior citizens. its become a very dirty business with rowdies taking control of this dirty business. Though Lord Balaji remains in my heart but I may not be able to contribute to this dirty business in future As always the best place to visit, a bliss full feeling after every visit I make it’s such a holy place no one could just describe in words. Looking forward to visit always if given chance. Due to pandemic could not travel this year, hope things will be back to normal soon I n my family booked ticket for darshan in TTD on May 1st but due to lockdown we couldn\\'t go. Surprisingly TTD came with bumper extension of one-year darshan for those who booked tickets during lockdown days.Finally today we had a good fully distanced n safe darshan . Thankyou TTD . Govinda Govinda🙏🙏 Best darshan ever in my life till date,the renovation works being carried out from alipiri to temple enroute by walk should be completed as soon as possible Triputi ji God of god\\'s ....I was so mesmerized with the entire aura around the temple .......I strongly advise all Hindu,Muslim,Sikh and Christians should visit and get solace to get the devine ashirwad of Vishnu ji After a year of covid pandemic, My family decided to step out to get the blessings from Lord Perumal. Myself ,my husband and 10 year old daughter. We have booked Rd 300 ticket a month before through TTD website. 29th march we reached down Tirupathi and stayed in a hotel. Evening 4.30 pm we visited Alamelu mangapura and parking is on the road itself near the temple. Crowd was less comparatively. we had a good darshan and returned to hotel by 5.30 pm. Next day 30th March we started and parked our car in Alipiri (Free parking). First thing to keep in mind that the total journey takes 5 to 6 hours. We started our first time walk journey to visit Perumal @ 8 am. Steps are steep till 2150 steps. we completed the 2000+ steps by 10.45am. we have taken rest every 50 steps. Ample of refreshments available. Only water was not available til half of the stretch and then they sell water in bottles. (Rs 50). Due to humid and hot we have exhausted all water and started taking some energy drink as well. after 2150 steps it was comparatively easy since it was like walking path and little steps. during one stretch work was going on hence we have been asked to go in trekking path. Later at one stage we have to walk in a road where vehicles are also coming. After crossing this we will reach steep step again. Last 1700 steps are like walk /steps and it is really steep at places. In between we took too many rests since my husband had a cramp in leg. Finally we reached Tirumala @ 2pm. We have taken a jeep ,who took Rs 200 for dropping to Rs 300 entry. We went inside the entrance and submitted the ticket, Aadhar card and luggage, phone. Crowd was very less in 300 entry and total time was less than 20 minutes to get Lord perumal\\'s darshan. 2.40 pm we came out. Collected laddu and it was crowded. Tool almost 20 minutes. later we have taken a jeep (Rs 800) and reached Alipiri Parking. Tips: Take ample of water with you. Total journey time is 5 to 6 hours for average walking person. before journey have some practice of climbing steps. There are more than 2500 reviews on Tirumala temple but not even one give you a complete idea of what to expect and look for in the temple.  The rush of pilgrims has to be seen to be believed. But the crowd management is excellent and you do not have to worry on that account. However, in the overall rush and the continuous movement most fail to observe the architectural beauty of the temple. I am therefore putting down a simple guide that you can read before entering the queue.  You first enter through the first entrance Mahadwaram which is capped by an impressive fifty feet high gopuram. Also referred to as Padi vakili it was built by Vijayanagar emperor Srikrishna Devaraya. The grand gopuram has several Tamil inscriptions from the 13th century. It is richly decorated with a number of stucco figures of Vaishnava gods like Hanuman, Kevale Narasimha and Lakshmi Narasimha. On either side of this main entrance there are two feet high statues made of alloy metal. They are Sankanidhi and Padmanidhi who are the guardians of ‘Navanidhi’, the treasure of Lord Sri Venkateswara. These statues were consecrated by Vijayanagar emperor Achyutha Rayalu, the younger brother of Sri Krishna Deva Raya. On the right side of the entrance, you can see the crowbar used by Anantalwar.  The door leads into a courtyard. On right side of the Mahadwaram are copper statues of Srikrishna Devaraya and his two queens- Tirumala Devi and Chinna devi. On the left side is a copper statue of Venkatapati Rayalu, the king of Chandragiri. Besides him are stone statues of an unknown king and his consort.  Krishna deva Rayalu Mandapam, Rangnayaka Mandapam built by Ranganadha Yadava Rayalu, Addala mandapam, Tirumalaraya Mandapam built by Saluvanarasimha Rayalu, Dwajasthambham, (the golden flagstaff) and Bali Peetam are all located in this courtyard. During Brahmotsavams, a flag with Garuda’s imprint is hoisted on this flagstaff for extending an invitation to gods and goddesses to attend this festival. Near the flagstaff are three copper statues of Lala khemaramu, his mother Mata Mohana Devi and his wife Pita Bibi. Lala Khemarumu is also known locally as Raja Todaramallu. Four pavilions in the four corners here were built by Saluva Narasimha Raya in 1470 A.D. The temple kitchen is also located here.  The second silver entrance Nadimi Padi Kavali leads to inner courtyard. It is also capped by an impressive gopuram. The doors of this entrance were silver plated in 1929 CE. by Sriram Dwarakadas Pharabhani and hence also called Vendi Vakili. Beyond the silver door, the path which circumambulates the main gopura of Ananda Nilayam is known as ‘Vimana Pradakshina’. In this pathway one can see Sri Ranganadha just opposite to the silver entrance, Sri Varadaraja Swami temple, Sannidhi Bhashyakarulu - the seat of Sri Ramanuja, the temple of Yoganarasimhaswami, Lords’ hundi and the seat of Vishvaksena.  This courtyard leads to the third and final golden gate Bangaru vakili. The thick wooden door is covered with gilt plates depicting the dasavataram of Lord Vishnu. Opposite to the golden gate, there is Garuda Mandapam. It was built in 1461 A.D. by Mallanna, a native of Chandragiri and minister in the Vijayanagara empire. To the south of the golden gate in this mandap, two big bells are suspended from a wooden log using iron chains. The Brahmin who rings this bell is called ‘Ghantapani’. The ringing of this bell denotes that it is time for the Lord to have his meal. Historical records say that whenever the emperor of Vijayanagara Empire camped at Chandragiri, the bell sounds were relayed to Chandragiri through intermediary bell porches enabling the emperor to have his food thereafter. Keeping the legacy live, even today in Tirumala, many devotees have their food only after the bell stops ringing. On either side of the golden gate, there are Jaya and Vijaya, the chief guards of the Lord, holding a conch, a disc and a mace respectively.  The spot where Lord Sri Venkateshwara’s statue is located in the Sanctum Sanctorum is called Ananda Nilayam. As you come out after having darshan you can see a golden gate that is opened only on occasion of Vaikunth Ekadashi. The golden gopuram on Ananda Nilayam is the ‘Ananda Nilaya Vimana’, which is also known as Bangaru Gopura Vimanam. As per mythology, Garuthmantha (Vehicle of Sri Vishnu) brought this Ananda Nilaya Vimanam from Vaikunth (the celestial abode of Lord Vishnu) and consecrated it here. This golden gopuram carries 64 images of various deities of Hindu mythology. Lord Sri Venkateswara is ingrained on Ananda Nilaya Vimanam is called Vimana Venkateswara. Devotees pray to him looking at the gopuram. In the pavilion nearby called ‘Sannidhi Bhashyakarulu’ is a granite statue of Sri Ramanuja in this pavilion. A little ahead is the temple of Yoganarasimhaswami. The flower chamber Yamunottarai where flowers used for the service of the Lord and other deities are stored is located close by. After having the darshan of the Lord, the devotees deposit their offerings to the Lord in the Srivari Hundi. A tall statue of Bangaru Varalakshmi (Golden Varalakshmi) is on the left side wall.  As you come out of the Mahadwaram, you turn left where there are counters that serve you the prasad. Date of visit – 3rd March 2021  • The Plan: Info about the date of release of Darshan Tickets and Accommodation was posted on the home page of TTD about a week in advance. I blocked my Google calendar for a timely reminder 1 day before the release of quota.  • Actual booking: Website hangs often on the booking day due to heavy traffic, but I managed to book Darshan Tickets first and Accommodation few hours later. Not sure why TTD doesn’t follow IRCTC type of rolling booking system (1 day quota release per day instead of releasing 30 days quota on a single day). Without Darshan tickets, Pilgrims are not allowed to go to Tirumala (stopped at Alipiri check post itself)  • Accommodation: I booked the highest category online accommodation available (got Ashta Vinayaka Cottage/ Guest House at the time of actual allotment – Rs.1500 per day); Got to know later that TTD doesn’t allow online bookings for even more premium guest houses like Sannidanam and Padmavati. These are reserved for VVIPs & their ‘Followers’. Not fair for normal devotees.  • Food: Except one (Sannidanam Restaurant), all other restaurants are closed at TTD at present (it seems the last Auction in September 2020 failed due to no bidders to run the restaurants). Pilgrims have to rely on heavily crowded unhygienic food courts. Perfect example of Red Tape, which doesn’t care about the hardship it causes to thousands of Pilgrims everyday  • Water: Plastic is banned in Tirumala (so you have to depend on RO Units for water). Carry a good bottle with you  • Social distancing: TTD officially declares that in Jan 2021 there were about 50,000+ devotees per day. Social distancing is almost impossible to follow. Can’t blame anyone!  • Darshan time: It took us about 2hrs 30 min for Darshan with waiting in just one compartment. We went straight to Compartment No 9 (and thought, our Darshan will be over in 30 more minutes!), and then waited without a clue for about an hour in the same compartment. It would be good if TTD can manage to give ‘some idea’ about the waiting time to the Pilgrims waiting in the compartments. People becomes desperate when they are clueless  • Extra Laddus & Carry bags: We bought additional laddus for family & friends (advance booked). The surprise here is, TTD wants Piligrims to buy Covers separately by standing in a different Queue again. Didn’t get the logic here. They should just add the price of carry bags in the price of Laddus so that Pilgrims holding 5-6 laddus in hand don’t drop parts of it on the floor and unnecessary inconvenience is not caused to the Pilgrims  • Dress code: Dress wear is clearly mentioned on the Tickets. Just refer to that. Just to add, these restrictions are not applicable to normal devotees in Padmavati Temple in Tirupati. May be dress code is there for people who perform special Sevas.  • Walking around/ Footwear/ Hot Sun - Even in the first week of March, temperature was quite high. TTD clearly doesn’t care about what the devotees should do, when they have to leave the footwear near one gate (in our case it was ATC Circle) and exit from another gate after having Darshan and comeback searching for footwear in scorching heat of Sun. Absence of clear directions can make one run bare foot in the wrong direction only to realize the correct direction later. Road surfaces are hot enough to cause blisters on your feet. TTD can lay walking mats and keep them cool by pouring water on it. But clearly they don’t bother about this (Typical argument could be – “Hardship is a must to receive God’s grace”).  • Better Accommodation: We felt it would have been much better to pay little more and stay in a comfortable hotel in Tirupati rather than staying in TTD Guest Houses at Tirumala. Ashta Vinayaka Cottage/ Guest House where we stayed was pretty clean with good facilities & friendly staff, but the neighbor disturbance was very high. This becomes a major issue when we have to bear corridor talks at 12 pm at night or say 4 am in the morning!  • Checkout time is 24 hrs from the time cottage & room allotment is done at CRO office. Checkout time is punched in by the counter staff at the guest house. If you get a doubt how to extend the stay by say an hour, discuss it with the counter staff at the time of check in itself. They will give few tips.  To SUM-UP!! In my personal experience, Tirupati Balaji can create unbelievable miracles in our lives. Darshan experience of barely 10 seconds itself is very powerful experience. Tirupati is far better managed than many other Pilgrim Places in India. But there is still scope for improvement for TTD.  Govinda, Govinda!! Heard a lot about this temple and so wanted to visit once after staying in bangalore for years . We didn’t get booking on the website so took from an agent Balaji travels who overcharge us almost 7 times for the darshan booking as we planned last moment and wanted the darshan ticket .  After reaching temple we entered at 9 am and our darshan was scheduled at 10 am . Took almost 3 hrs waiting in a dedicated area and then aur started for main temple darshan .  This was chaos ,people were forcing each other to get into the temple at last strech of 15-20 mins . At this situation of covid ,it should be managed well atleast the que and male female separate line . Inside temple it’s just 10 second darshan as security force you to move quickly out but that darshan was divine and worth the wait of 4 hrs . Thirumala temple best temple in the work it\\'s very good to go by walk it\\'s was so difficult to go walk with family what be relly enjoyed We had booked on line darshan . Only traditional dress like dhotis are to be worn. While mask wearing is enforced , social distancing is not all maintained. Still had very good darshan of Lord Balaji and took HIS Blessings The laddu counters are very mismanaged abd not proper communication for closure for lunch.., This was my first time and I was very nervous as I was traveling alone..I was really soooo lost...the customer service really helped by guiding me through the darshans and what is to be done amd the type of Darshans. I’m so grateful to them. Thanks team TTD because of your help and guidance I managed to have beautiful Darshans. Really appreciate your service..such a big help to a new solo female traveller ❤️ What better way to kick start a new year than a visit to Lord Sri Venkateshwara, especially given one stays in Tirupati, the city at the foothills of the temple.  New year\\'s vacation period during a closing pandemic was alluring beyond ordinary. This led me to take up the Tirumala trip by foot, for the first time. I had booked a 10AM slot on 9th Jan for darshan through the offical website ( you have to be quick, else the slots get filled quite fast); shoutout to local Instagram pages for giving the heads up.  You can find the route length, facilities along the way and related info in the other posts for this topic. I thought I\\'ll mention a few lesser know facts and preperation required.  Skipping to the flag off day:  I started early at the Alipiri steps ( there are two routes, the other being Sri vari metalu), around 6:45 am. You can drop in your luggage here and collect it near the temple, or if it\\'s a bag pack or something similar, can carry it like I did, without much difficulty. Wear comfortable clothes for the ascent, as you have to change to traditional attire ( dhoti or kurts for men and sari or chudidar for women) only before entering the temple premises. I suggest you go barefoot; and please note, it is not mandatory to do so,but this after all is a holy climb. Moreover you\\'ll find pilgrims placing kunkum and Khalid on every step, a few even lighting camphor, so it is indeed inappropriate to have footwear in the vicinity. The steps are regularly swept and floor is quite easy on the naked foot. Dont be worried about water, food, snacks or toilets on the way. There are many options sensibly spaced.  To give a brief idea about the route, first about 2000 steps are only steps, reasonably steep. Later on its lavishly spanned with long stretches of flat walls, surrounded by splendid greens. Then about 2800 steps later, you reach Sri Laksmi Narasimha Swami temple, from where you merge with the road used by vehicles on the way down. And the journey culminates with some steps named \"Mokalu mettalu\" ( Knee steps, as few devotees climb them on their knees!).  I finished the climb from bottom to the entrance of the temple in 2 hrs. I know, sounds too much of a claim, but I went hard, took it as an endurance test for myself. Took literally no rest stops and paced up all the way. Was very exhilarated on completion though. And I guess if attempted at a normal pace, in a relaxed fashion, it would easily take 3 to 3.5 hrs.  All in all, the effort is rewarding. Darshan was peaceful as well. And I went ahead and took the way back on foot again, through the same route. Now it was a little faster, about 1.45 hrs. But be very careful, as getting down is actually more hard, needs your constant attention and control over body.  Hope you have a fun climb too! Cheers. Visited temple on 28th Dec. It takes 2 hrs after entry to get Darshan. Energetic temple vibes are really powerful. Temple was very nicely decorated with flowers and very good fragrance all around. Nice administrative setup for queue and online bookings. Ladoo prasad is so pure and so tasty. Perhaps the most well organized setup, I ever saw at any pilgrimage place in India. Kudos to mgmt for amazing upkeep 👍 The temple town is neatly maintained The ghat road is very smooth and one way The que system was good We visited thirumala as we had to submit offerings to the Lord.We had taken V.I.P DARSHAN Ticket as other form of darshan not allowed now due to COVID.We had to plan two weeks before the trip and report one day before the darshan to confirm our darshan timings. We have visited earlier some 2 years back, that sanctity i felt, is lost now.It was not a good experience as we could not get accomodation near to temple.....We had to wait for 2hours for darshan and we could not get proper glance of the LORD as the security were pushing a lot. Actually,as per our experience,Thirumala BALAJI very famous and powerful blessings too....but due to COVID...no proper maintenance....and average experience. A piece of advice.....unless it is really necessary,plan,...otherwise avoid till the COVID period.... The lords visit which filled my heart with blessings.Nothing to speak the experience I had from lords divinity. Hail lord jagannath. Very pious, serene and holy shrine a must visit temple for everyone blessed to see a divine glimpse of the lord. A place every hindu should visit in india.Very affordable you can get a room here for 100 rs per night and visit temple.Very affordable breakfast. This is not just a place of pilgrimage.. this is also the place, where one could feel and understand the meaning of patience, bakthi, faith and also the real devotion to the supreme Lord God Himself..  Irrespective of the distance from where the people come to this place, we could feel the chanting of \" Govinda\" by all those who are moving in the huge queue for having darshan of Lord Venkateshwara.  The maintenance and the facilities given by the temple authorities to the devotees are really excellent.. The place where you refresh you mind and i better say inner peace. Just chanting Govindha and Sit at a place after Srivari Dharsanam and close your eyes for a min. You will find meaning of life and happiness Due to coronovirus, no rush. we can worship within an hour. os usual inside rush is there. there should be separate outgate. since for coming outside the temple also, heavy crowdy and rush. no proper measures taken Its is the right example to the whole world for maintenance of religious temple. the queue maintenance is excellent. Every lack of pilgrims are visiting without any inconvenience. We can appriciate the TTD Trust to providing free meals to pilgrims without any confusion. Its a great, great holy place in the world. It was a nice and awesome place for dev Darshan,ye place ghumne ke liye bohot hi jyada accha hai,hum log online room booking bhe kar sakte hai but uske liye aapko 3months pehle room book karna hoga,and kisi ko waha pe ghumne ke liye travels chahiye hoga to mujhe contact karo,waha pe meri pehchan wala 1 aadmi hai jo aapko saste mai sab places ghuma dega... Visiting Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala has become more comfortable with new facilities. Now you can expect the darshan is completed within 2 hours on a normal day in Rs 300 category. Waiting and handling of pilgrims has become much better. I visit Tirumala temple almost every 2 years. Excellent management. Booked darshan ticket online @Rs 300/- per Head. Earlier we had one issue that Shoes have to deposited near entry of temple and exit is different side. So one needs to go back again to collect the Shoes. Now TTD has made arrangements so that shoes can be taken back near exit and this saves time and hassles. Good tour very nice and peaceful. Aptdc has the best tour option for all. The rates are the best and cheap.the comfort is better than any other mode. It is a very devotional place and visitable place with out hesitation.those who have not visited tirumala. They have lost the opportunity to see such a wonderful place We had booked Rs 10000 VIP break darshan under srivani trust scheme. Three people visited. Our reporting time was 6.15 AM in the morning. We reached at 5.45 AM. As we had the VIP tickets, the police allowed our car near VQC 1 for drop off. There was a que and about 100 people were there. Our tickets and ID were checked properly. After walking for 5 mins we were made to sit in a compartment. They served us Coffee and Milk. It was very good. AT about 7 AM pongal was served which was tasty. At about 7.25 AM we were allowed for darshan and the line started. Our tickets were checked again. By 8.15 we were near the sanctum. We went inside and had a very close darshan of Lord Venkatesa. We had goose bumps and my mother was very happy and moved. we gradually entered the sanctum in line and we went very close to the god, just 3 feet away. We never had such a experience in life. We appreciate TTD for such an initiation. One of the or may be the most famous South Indian Temple, Tirupati located on hills of Tirumala house of Lord Venkateshwara is a very good temple where daily thousands and lakhs pilgrims visit. There are many ways to book to enter the temple to view or get Darshan of Lord Venkateshwara and all options are available online. It is compulsory that online reservation / booking is done prior to get specific date for Darshan. There is also another way for Darshan if online booking couldn\\'t be done which is directly proceed to foothills of Tirumala and climb the hills by steps. One way is 9km long and the other ways is about 3km long but is steep to climb. It generally takes about 2 hours to reach the main temple after you have started your in your line as per the given time slot. In the main temple is Lord Venkateshwara. After Darshan as per your ticket you are entitled for the world famous laddus here. They are very unique. Please remember before you start your line for Darshan of Lord Venkateshwara please visit the Varsha Swamy Temple first and take bath in the Holy pond. Also please wear only traditional clothes here. In the picture I here is shown the main temple. Inner most building is real gold plated. Lord Venkateshwara bless all. After the night shift, vignesh came to trtr and called me at 7.30 morning. I have also packed my bag and we headed towards ekm railway station. Banglore express 12678 have arrangements for our travel. We started on time. Nature of the land scape change as it crossed wadakkencherry n ottapalam. We have come to the rural agricultural areas of Malabar. Rolls of dry grasses after cultivations, cows goats and birds involved in their daily news update. Cranes stand still as white clothes are laid on these fields. As if they check the law and order among them. Crossed the walayar and ghat section it is completely masked by the tall rocky structures of the Western Ghats. Reach salem. Vivekananda bar behind joy Alukkas. From salem railway station need to get bus to new bus station. Got the setc bus to tirupati. The bus was in perfect time. Facility in tirupati bus station for toilet and other morning purpose is very good. Next is to get the bus to sreevaru mettu. It is available from the railway station. There\\'s no bus from tirupati bus stand before 7. An auto for 50/- Will take you to the exact bus station. It is walkable only. Bus is crowded. The roads are extremely good. We can stand and sleep with out any bumpers. Bus will drop you at the luggage center. You will get free rooms right there. Take money mobile and keep footwear inside bag and hand over. This will be carried through cargo to the top. Climb 2388 step. Steep climbing. Darshan token will be provided in the way as you climb the steps. Once you get the time to darshan you can manage the pace of climbing. If it is in the evening you can rest more and enjoy the scenery. Provide small helps to others. Reach tirumala temple place after all the steps. All toilet and social use facilities are extremely clear, clean and safe. I can never imagine walking barefoot in kochi. But here it is not an issue. It is very very very clean. Small trees are there which helps with its shadow to avoid the burns. There is ro filtered water every 100feet. No bottled water is provided. It is banned. Towards right you reach the prebooked darshan point. Towards left you can go to the divya darshan point which is given for sreveru mettu climbers. We had enough time for that. Anna prasadam center is huge Hall provide breakfast lunch and dinner according to the specified times. There\\'s is big wall painting of tirumala. We have to take the tirumala bus. It is 4bus stop away. People will get in bus and will not move back. So take the hard way to get in(pushing and pulling). Luggage center is just at the exit of anna prasadam center. There\\'s a shopping place where photo small statues and various ornamental things are available. Small food outlets are there. Reach the point and the grilled path will take you to darshan. That\\'s a magical management by tirumala devaswam. Security check will be done before you move to the compartment. It is all a sequential process. One after the other. Enter in the compartment where need to wait. Darshan took almost 4hours wait. You can stand for approximately 10seconds after all the efforts. Pray and chant\\'govinda govinda\\'. After the darshan it will lead us to the laddu center. After the darshan sreevaru mettu climbers if they had dropped the luggage at the starting point you have to take the tirumala bus from the luggage centre circle to tbc point. Mobiles will be available at the normal luggage center. Get the tirupati bus back to town. It\\'s full hairpin bends. In the night if you return take the right side seat. Towards the town its a beautiful view of city\\'s light and houses like stars in the sky. Lot of accommodation facility at the bus station. Dwaraka is a 3star one. Hotel paradise is good for non veg. Most of the other hotels provide ac rooms around 1200-1500. Next day, Take the nonstop srikalahasti bus from tirupati stand. Enquiry is available at every 100m distance. This is another wonderful thing. Extremely satisfied with the experience by the employees. Their behavior and service. Srikalahasti, is not that crowded. If you are in hurry take the 200token. It is notified that mobile is not allowed but many take it inside. If you are able to, it\\'s very good. There\\'s a lot to fill in your gallery. Structure of the temple built on rock is fantastic. Breeze out side is very cool. Rahu ketu counter is outside on the way to gate 4. Anna prasadam center is there at the out after the darshan. We return to the bus stop. The pineapple juice from the shop at the stop is very good. Took the same bus back to room. Got the setc Coimbatore bus. Got the supaa travel to vytilla. Reach home. Om namo narayanaya. Om namah shivaya. We climbed the Alipiri Mettu to get here. It was a surprise to find Tirumala to be like a small town rather than just a temple. It even has its own bus stand and petrol station!. We found it to be vibrant and freindly. we had been to kodur to atttend a wedding, in the tirupati district. we had booked the special darshan ticket online 3 months prior. the lines are systematic it gets very crowded near the diety. we cud complete our darshan in one hour. we got 10 seconds to see the lord.. we had the laddus and came out, very satisfying visit I had visited Tirumala for a wedding and took the opportunity to seek Lord Balaji\\'s efficiency. I booked special darshan for Rs. 300 per head online in November 2019 through a spotlessly efficient process. Chose a 2 pm darshan and reported 10 minutes before. Darshan was done by 2.45 and we collected the laddus available as part of the darshan from the counter. Darshan was from outside but Balaji being large, we could clearly see him. We had booked a room, again through the online process which was again seamless from booking to allocation and cost 1k. The room was very spacious, modern and neat. We had free lunch at the Annaprasada center which was wholesome, hot and well organised. Tirumala reminded me of a Singapore or Geneva on the neatness(including public toilets) and staff efficiency front. There r free buses to move around at good frequency. Keep up the good work, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD)! One of the Beautiful and Divine Place in the earth Once You get Darshana You feel Peaceful in the Soul , First visit Padmavathi temple in Tirupathi then Bhoo Varahaswamy Temple in Tirumala land Lord of Tirumala And Then Srivari This How We Have to visit to Tirumala for Darshana Om Namo Venkateseya 🙏🙏 Lord had given a good darshan. I had travelled via Sri Vaari Mettu pathway, and had been given the timing at 3.00 pm. Entered the cage around 1.30 pm and the darshan was completed by 5.00 pm. Since it was a Saturday, heavy crowd was there. The temple is situated on the top of Tirumala. We have taken online booking from TTD website (Rs. 300) per head. The visit was in January and we had to wait around 1 hour for the Darshan. The arrangement is great but the crows are huge too and if you opt to get sarvadarshan like I did, you may end up waiting for 8-10 hours even in non-peak time. so get a 300 Rs special darshan ticket else don\\'t go. A visit to the Temple happens only when there is a call from the Lord himself and a connect establishes with our soul, thats the starting point. This is never a casual tick in the box visit. No amount of planning and perfection helps as its the God’s connect with you and his grace that decides your coming to the temple and having a good darshan of the Lord. Having said the above, please plan well to execute the visit. With complete divinity of purpose and focus, take a e darshan ticket and be on time at the gate with the id proof that was used for booking the ticket. Take a printout of the ticket. Once in the que, its destiny how long one needs to be in the line, depends upon the time of the year and whether its peak time or otherwise. For the 300 Rs online ticket, one can expect a wait time of 1 to 2.5 hrs normally. Feb is non peak. Be mindful of the attire. Need to completely attired head to toe with traditional indian attire and preferably in white dhoti (called Veshti) for men and women indian attire. No pants please. The darshan of the lord is ultimate connect of the Soul. Its so powerful and the vibes and the current it generates is unbelievable in the backdrop of the chanting noise of ‘Govinda, Govinda, Venkataramana, Govinda, Srinivasa Govinda’ Be with the rhythm and the flow and submit with focus to the Lord. The brief face to face with the God is ultimate and life undergoes a sea change with a visit. Offer your prayers and His grace will be all over you for transformation and a new beginning. The Lord blesses you unconditionally in every visit. A satisfied inner fulfilling experience every time. A beautiful place and very well managed. The temple premises is awesome. The whole process of darshan is seamless. A must visit place for everyone. May Lord Balaji bless us all. Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam is very beautiful to visit Lord of vishnu near Andhra Pradesh, India.. Here in tirupati you can enjoy alot.come along with friends gang and go to tirumala.youbguys will have a lot of fun.later after darshan go to thalakona and jungle book.also the beast places to see are shilparaman and chandragiri fort and science centre. It is a well renowned mandir in South India as well in whole of India. Must must visit for Hindus as it is a very good temple but too crowded specially on weekends it was my first visit to Thirumala and I was overawed by everything I saw and experienced. Stayed at Tirupathi (Hotel Udaya International) and drove up to Thirumala hills for the darshan. The Darshan itself was wonderful however, the manner in which the pilgrims are literally put into a cage as they await their turn and the rude behavior of the staff with the poor pilgrims was something I could have done without witnessing at a pilgrimage site. But then a glimpse of Lord Venkateshwara made the journey worth the effort. Jai Govinda! and the chance to donate one\\'s hair at Kalyan Katta to our Lord was once in a lifetime. A definite must visit - recommended that you book your special darshan tickets online at TTD Seva. Incase, it is an impromptu calling of the Lord, just make your way to the Srinivasam Complex at around 3 am and wait till the ticket window opens around 7 am to take your tickets. Only 500 tatkal tickets are issued per day so hurry and reach there early. Don\\'t forget to carry your Aadhar Card without which you will not get the Darshan Ticket. With this Special Darshan Ticket, it will take you a maximum of 2 hours or so to get the Darshan. Right from the first toll... the atmosphere just became spiritual and mind blowing!! The temple campus is managed so well and neat.. just fantabulous.... No words to explain the feelings at the time of the actual darshan of Lord Venkatesha !! It\\'s about 3500 steps uphill & almost 12-13km distance, If you are a sucker for nature its best for you walk your way to tirumala. you can find deer parks, lush green forest, food joints, waterfalls, deep valleys on your way up. The temple trek uphill is a great way to have darshan and a extended family comprising of 16 members from 14 to 70 years walked all the way. It was difficult but all enjoyed with good company. Had a delicious breakfast and waited for our turn for the darshan. After seeking the blessings of Lord and donating part of our earnings again has prasadam. It was a rather quick journey as we started at 6.00 AM and finished collecting our share of ladoos by 12.00 noon Happy to be blessed My favourite temple, in Feb 2019 we had visited this temple for Kalyanotsavam & again in May 2019 for Sahasradeepalankarana seva on our twins birthday. Must visit temple at least once in our lifetime. I have booked kalyana seva of God Venkateswara & Padmavthi by advance booking. I also advance booked my accommodation on hills at Tirumala. I went in to line at 8am and checked my self with family and waited for seva inside the temple. We were allowed inside the temple by 10.15 am and made to sit. The Kalyanam started at 12 noon and concluded by 13.15. Then we were sent for darshan of God Venkateswara. We were given sesha vastram and after darshan we are asked to collect Laddu prasad. The rooms were super good and have hot water, have westren and India toilets. Hit water is available in the accommodation. One of the most important temple in the locality. You will always find this place crowded as it is one of the most visited place Any one will like to visit this temple but without any pre booking for free darshan you have to wait for 4-5hrs depending on rush.please book well in advance with any darshan slots by on line. Very peaceful and clean temple.govinda...govinda An excellent experience culminating in a minute of unhindered view of Lord balaji. These are memorable experiences of one\\'s lifetime Hi visitors, I am writing this reviews who are willing to darshan Sree Balaji temple but worried about the crowed. I visited on 13th November 2019 with my infant and aged parents. It took 1.5 hrs only. I booked sheeghra darshan ticket from their website. I followed some categories before choosing the date and time for darshanas I wanted to darshan peacefully. I avoided Brahmotsavam, Purnima, Ekadoshi, Dwadashi, weekends, any national holidays. I traveled with family on 24.12.19 from Chennai. Someone from office suggested me to go for TTDC for timely Darshan. So I got 4 tickets done for four of us(including my parents)through website and it was smooth. It cost 1850*4= 7400. Only thing is no ordinary/AC tour was available. Only three Volvo bus were there.(probably they do not do ordinary trip which may decrease their revenue, fair enough) It was mentioned to reach 30 mins prior to departure that effectively comes to 4.30 am. So plan accordingly. We at 4.30 am reached at TTDC office in Anna Salai, Chennai. Our bus no was 6868.(got a SMS from ttdc just previous night with bus no and details) Bus was nice and a guide was given to every bus. Bus was having a sound system for any announcement and was in good condition. On the way to Tirupati we were given breakfast at a restaurant which was of good quality. On reaching tirupati at 9.20, we were transferred to APSRTC bus since big buses would not be allowed on the route.On the way to tirumala, security checks were done.  In tirumala near to temple they have a rented flat/cottage SN303 (Sahadri Nagar 303) where clothes can be changed, washroom is also available. Phones, cameras, chappal are not allowed in main temple. So pilgrims must leave it there. Now with guide all the people of a particular bus will proceed to special darshan temple queue of temple. From then on it is auto-pilot. You follow the queue and after going through many waiting halls and more queues Lord Venketeshwara will oblige you with Darshan. We got darshan at 3.30pm. After Darshan, the guide will meet you the shop right opposite to the main temple.(below Hanumananuman temple) Will give you 2 Laddus per ticket and lunch token. Then you can go for lunch and from there return to the cottage, as they say, SN 303. Phones which were collected before leaving cottage will be given to you. After all persons of a bus return, everyone with respective guide will move towards nearby bus stand where they were earlier dropped. An APSRTC bus will be boarded and it will drop you at TTDC bus down the hill. From here we will again proceed to Chennai.  Now everything looks almost perfect except time taken in Darshan. Why is rating only average?  I have to admit that as per planning and process it stands for 5 rating. But there is a lot to improve on people side. Especially the guides, they have very apathetic towards pilgrims and have a attitude of high-handedness. They sees tourist as cattle. They will try to speak over you, gag you. My mom was having difficulty walking. Instead of offering any help, he kept pestering us all along- suppose you don\\'t return time, bus will leave. He got the other guides repeating the same stuff....you should have come through booking and all... (guess what we were the first from our bus to return to cottage and guide himself came after an hour.)  Other one was mockingly asked my mom if she has a bomb in the belt to support her waist...such offending remarks!  My guide even asked me some money for local expenses almost in the manner as if 1850 per person does not cover it. Though he added \\'whatever you like to give\\' afterwards. My boss earlier told that they have some understanding with staff for priority queue and quick darshan. I did not notice any such thing.  We were not taken to padmavathi temple as promised. The guide even tried his best to skip a meal/evening tea and directly took us to chennai. But because of few assertive ladies(whom the guide was blaming for delay in the trip), he had to provide us the dinner at the same place where we had breakfast, again very nice.  Lunch token was given for a near-by restaurant which serves very avg food.  So overall, it was five star on process management but 2 star on staff and people management to TTDC.  PS: Don\\'t forget to take the *hardcopy* of aadhar card. All 3-4 buses pilgrims will use same cottage for the same time. So you might feel a bit stuff. Prepare to walk a long stretch. Reconsider if you are not well and rather aged Very good and excellent.. very old temple it has lot of memories attached to it .. had a very good time Temple is very clean and excellent facilities are provided for the devotees. Recent addition of sevadals for crowd management and control seems to have eased the flow little as they do it as a seva, they dedicate themselves in their duty with a service mind. They have opened free prasadam around Tirumala which is amazing. Here God answer your prayers. The nature is at its best. Temple is in hill surrounded by beautiful forest, architecture buildings of ancient India, rich satvik prasad, lot of convenience, a good treatment is provided for elders, youngsters, speciality peoples. A place makes you experience that Paradise existed before 3000 years. This temple is famous for laddus, so yummy and tasty. The laddus are believed to stay fresh for 10 days. In temple they offer delicious prasad like tamarind rice, curd rice, Pongal. Tirumala temple is famous not only in south but is verg famous all over in india. From very far people come for for praying and with their wishes. This Temple is really an astonishing one in the world..  Every day around 20,000 to 50,000 people from all over India come here to offer their prayers and pray for their welfare..  Clean and excellent facilities are provided for the devotees and simply excellent work is done by people who are working here..  Actually, \"People work here \" - This phrase is not correct..  To say really, \"People dedicate themselves in their duty\". Yes, this is correct (in my view, the service done by the people working in this Temple administration here is really incomparable)..  You should first visit 01. GovindaRaja perumal temple in the foothills of tirupati city.. 02. Then worship the kapileswarar temple and take a holy dip in the kapileswarar theertham  In the hills,  01. Varahasamy temple in the bank of pushkarani 02. Pray the hanuman Temple in front of the temple next.. 03. Then you should enter the line to worship Lord venkateswara..  Have a great Darshan and feel Blessed.. The visit to the Temple has been very spiritual for me. Only if they would allow 10 seconds per person would be great. Right now one gets only 2 seconds per person.

Lord venkateshwara temple most devoted place with cool climate all the time because it is built on 7 hills hight..., super place all must visit. Been visiting this place since my childhood days, and as always it is a great, peaceful environment I am around here! I Visited second time this place.it was crowded as usual. It took me about 1hour 30 min to have darshan of deity.as I climbed the tirumala hill in morning i got spectacular and magnificent view of surroundings greenery and and varied landscapes. Hundreds of devotees waicing in queue for darshan and prasad were seen.sufficient arrangemeets for all persons seen.I found rush and dangerousted crowding for exit after darshanand prasad.great place for all devotees and scholars.lot of food and refreshments around temple premises. Vow .superb.He will take care of all of us. Wonderful place to visit. I make it a point to visit the Temple once a year and every time I visit, feel like a satisfied soul after having Darshan. There\\'s no set of words that can explain the experience. The beauty of the temple and fervor of the devotees to get a glimpse of Lord Almighty Venkatesh makes it a unique experience. This is the abode of My Lord, there\\'s no other place in the universe like this. GLORY TO LORD VENKATESH We have lots of faith in God and especially Tirumala is the best place to visit and Temple is very big and TTD follows the proper process to help the pilgrims. MUST VISIT place and temple in SOUTH INDIA. One of the richest amount of donations received and which is been used in the form of trust. Which is being given back to people in the form of service. The maintenance in and around the temple have improved a lot. And the darshan timings have come down due to good management. The temple takes special care for visiting senior citizens, by issuing special pass up to 1000 nos a day. You are taken through a special enclosure and ensure you have darshan without much of pushing by other devotees. If you are an sr. citizen of 65 years and above, you should avail of this facility. Once you are inside in front of Lord Venkateshwara, you forget the world, and devote your time only at looking at Him! You will not even remember what you wanted to ask him. You know by seeing Him, you are taken care of the Lord himself, no need to ask for anything. Even the fleeting glimpse of the The LORD, is enough to give a sense of peace and tranquility. The power of the LORD is such that in spite of the hardships one has to endure to see HIM, it all pales into insignificance.  There are two ways to reach Tirumala where the temple is situated. One by road and the other climbing up the hills. Buses ply at regular intervals from Tirupati to Tirumala. One can also use their personal vehicles. Tirupati is connected to all major cities by road and rail and air. Climbing up the hills takes around 4 hrs or more depending on the physical condition of the person. Online booking is available for Darshan as also various Sevas performed in the Temple.s We have been visiting this temple since childhood days and over the past 15 years make a visit every year. The place provides an immense sense of peace and tranquility to all devotees and worshippers. This was my first time to Tirupati & unlike all my fears on not being able to do Darshan beyond few seconds, I was positively surprised. Firstly the journey to the top of the hill was mesmerising, with cool breeze, many monkeys, sights of people walking up & amazing views of the town. Food stores were lined up around the premises. While we didn’t stay in the guest houses in the vicinity, they looked inviting. We had booked an advance online pass for Darshan & moved straight to the start of the line. Happy with the security & ticket/Id checks. For the large crowds that arrive here, the lines were reasonably well organised. Happy that there are separate lines for moms with young children, older & specially abled people. Electronics, arms, leather items are prohibited. Clothing has to be appropriate with no shorts, trousers, pants for men but dhoti or kurta pyjama & sarees or salwar/ kameez for women. After around 3 hours in winding lines with chants of Govinda Govinda, we reached the entrance of the main dome. Water flowing at the entrance washed our bare feet. Lines were well organised & volunteers kept of moving people ahead. Once we entered the main hall, the sight was invaluable. Beautifully decorated & adorned idol of Lord Venkateswara was visible far across the hallway. Just at the opposite end was a smaller idol of the lord decorated with flowers. Chants filled the room & it was heavenly. Once out of the room, we got Prasadam of Pongal rice, some others got tamarind rice & some luckier ones got jaggery-rice. We took the Prasad of boondi laddus (stuffed with tasty cardamoms) & walked out of the premises feeling blissfully blessed......Excellent service & staff. Away from the hustle of the work, sometimes you should plan to be in touch with the super natural power which created all of us. Whenever I am at this temple I feel the same. I feel God is very near to us and thus it is a must visit for me. Although I want to visit this place as frequently as possible, however these days it is happening once in an year. MUST VISIT IF YOU ARE IN TIRUPATI I had visited the Tirupati tirumala devasthanam in October during my birthday,as it was a yearly bhramhotsava days.The place gives you a peace of mind and the weather is also good during that time Divine place to be visited. One of the most popular and beautiful temple. Located in Tirupati, Andhra pradesh. Pilgrims donate their hair to lord Vishnu and goddess Neeladri before entering the temple. It is considered to be the most sacred ritual of the temple. ritual revolves around the story where Lord Venkateswara was hit on his head by a shepherd, a small portion of his scalp became bald. This was noticed by Neela devi,with her magic she cut a portion of her hair and implanted it on his scalp. Lord Venkateswara noticed her sacrifice. As hair is a beautiful asset of the female form, he promised her that all his devotees who come to his abode would offer their hair to him, and she would be the recipient of all the hair received. Hence, it is believed that hair offered by the devotees is accepted by Neela Devi.  Information: Compulsory to take tickets before entering the temple. Two types of tickets are available.

I came from chennai to tirupati at 2:00am. Ive took an auto from bustop to alipiri (steps) as I decided to go by walk, autowala charged 70(early hours) normally 50bucks and others can go by taxi/bus/own vehicles. So Ive started at 2:30 from alipiri as I was alone it didn’t took much time forme. For pilgrims by walk they will give a token and time for free darshan it was 3:00pm for me as it was sunday (heavy rush for darshan on both sat and sun). I went to the hilltop around 5:30am and I had a room booked so I went there and got fresh up. Early in the morning tirumala was simply superb with all those mantras and songs, full of peace. I took some rest in remainin time and went to some more temples there. For darshan better book early (50-normally take5-6hrs, 300-takes3-4hrs) and mine is by walk literally took 8hrs ie I came out of temple at 11:00pm and took prasad after that which was the best part. After everything done ive took a bus from tirumala busstop as there are so many buses. On the whole worst experience. Bundled in a contract carrier. A rickety contraption.Worst of all no time management either before or after darshan .Chosen for food cheap way side eateries.Above all the eye sore the group psyche. Bad. Better to avoid. Sweetly the AP tour officials speak but less said is better. One of the top most visited temples visited by Indians.  Well maintained.  Do book seegra darshan if possible for quick darshan.  Helpdesk counters set up at every nearby points to help you with you query. I went for suprabatham seva on october 2019 which was selected in seva DIP 3 months before. It was a very god experience at morning 2.30 or 3.00 in between this time we have to attend the temple, the queue line starts beside the temple. we have to wait in the queue until they send,for people convienience they asked us to wait in a hall where all people are waiting there we can also sit there. after this they released the lines we all ran into, after some distance running the tickets were checked multiple times by officers. after this they set the people in the halls untill the pooja starts. after all wait is over they released and we reached into aananda nilayam. the priests chanted slokas of suprabatham which was a beautiful experience, after completion of slokas we are allowed near to the god for darshan and we are not offered any teertham some are writing theertham is offered, this was the beautiful of the suprabatham seva. Thank you we planned a tirupathi temple visits from Chennai. We too the Andhra pradesh Tourism Development Corporation in Chennai ,We booked on a Tuesday darshan for 1750 Rs each. The office was at Burkit Road, T-nagar 31/14. The bus boarding time was 05:00 AM. The bus started at 05:30 AM . Decent AC volvo bus with recliner and sufficient leg space . We reached a place for breakfast approx after 1.5 hrs. The breakfast was good in taste and quantity. we reached tirupathi at 9 Am . the bus took us up at 10 aM . The guide Ravi was very helpful and informative. We entered temple at 300Rs darshan side. It was ok inside as we Indians never will learn to behave well. we went in saw the main god Lord Venkateshwara and came out in 1.5 hrs. That was good. Each get 2 laddus for a ticket. You can buy extra for 50Rs each. The guide Ravi knew where to n get laddus faster.we went down and continued in Volvo bus for Alamemlu Mangapura. We stopped for lunch and that also was good , no complaints. We went to Alamemlu mangapura temple by 4 Pm, had a good darshan and also this is a mandatory visit for all if they visit tiurpathi. This is off the package . U can choose tickets from 20 , 100, 200 and 500 Rs . We had head back to Chennai after that we reached at 20:30 PM .  Good planning and guidance from this APTDC organisation.it is worth it for a day. well organised , very systematic. only one point of improvement is - increase signage, since there is language problem, and lots of devotee comes there, there should be many signage board showing counters to allocate rooms for online booking, laddu counter location with map.  over all experience was good, very positive energy in the temple, well management for crowd.  govinda... govinda.. Had a wonderful Balaji Darshan.Though entry is an ordeal but once in the view of the sanctum the feeling is very blessed. Visit the temple twice a year. Words cannot describe the feeling one gets when inside the sanctum, despite the pull and push and constant talking by the humans in the queue. Had taken a Rs. 300 ticket. Joined the queue at 9:15am, got the darshan by 1015am. Very fast. For sarvadarshan (with tokens), it is a 5 hour wait in the queue. It\\'s around 28 kilometres from Tirupati...atop a hill, you can see the lights on the temple from the train itself... from Saptagiri check point,the climb uphill starts...they check the car, screen your baggage and you have to step out of the car and move through the screening chamber to the other side of the check point.You have to make sure that you take atleast 28 minutes to reach the top.You should wear traditional dress;saree,salwar kameez with dupatta for ladies;mundu(dhoti) for men.For special darsan which you can book online,the rate is ₹300/- per person.There are several rest areas while waiting in queue;you are served tea/ coffee/ water free of cost.Everythingbis well arranged..no crowding,no rush,even children don\\'t have a hard time.Separate darshan\\'s are available for couples with less than one year old children.Go ahead for a great darshan..we are just back from one such. Never ever will visit again. If you have money to throw, if you are a powerful politician or vip govt official, you can stand near the balaji statue for five minutes. Or if you pay ₹10k for lord marriage ritual, you can sit near the statue for 30minutes.otherwise if you choose general dharshan, you will be caged for a day & treated like gutter worm. To hell with balaji temple. Tirumala hills is where Lord Venkateshwara\\'s devinity is felt all over. Entire tirumala temple premises is maintained so well and clean, there are drinking water outlets, washrooms, anna prasadam counters, pilgrim facilitation counters and security centers to help the pilgrims to their best. Lots of free buses to climb up and down the hill. Every volenteer is dedicated to serve the needs of pilgrims which is overwhelming. Always wanted to visit but little bit scared about crowd and management But really it was a great experience for us. My suggestion is as follows for 1st time visitors. Don\\'t book anything online other then VIP darshan if you want to quick darshan. But it was nice to normal darshan also. Directly go to tirumula from tirupati by APSRTC bus which is 1 hour journey uphills. There you can keep your baggage and family at one place and go to CRO office for room booking. Always keep Adhar, Mobile and ATM card. After getting registration you will be able to get room in 2 or 3 Hrs. Then go to allotted room and relax. In the morning at 4AM counter opens for free token. Get token for free darshan. Don\\'t worry about free darshan long time because you enjoyed this a lot. On 2nd day book APSRTC for 4 temple visit. These buses are plying in every 10 mints. The place is well organised.. although there is a mad rush to the temple, but very well managed, clean and you finish the entire process in a few hours. The drive to and back is also stunning. Recently I and my friend visited Tirupati Tirumala temple. I have been visiting the temple twice a year. It is indeed surprising how they manage so big crowd every day,specially Saturday and Sunday. I appreciate their skills of managing the rush. I will add here that if you are looking for Accommodation in Tirumala (current booking) Of ₹500. You have to wait atleast 5/6 hours. Where as ₹50 /100 easily available. So book in advance. The darshan was mesmerizing and worth the wait . We took about two hours to complete the darshan . Important points : 1. Keep footwear and mobile phone in the cars. 2. Take required money for donation. 3. Wear less jewellery as its very crowded. 4. Dress code Men: veshti/dhoti , kurta pyjama/churidar. No jeans allowed. Women: saree, lehenga, salwar kurta/churidar, duppatta is compulsory. 5. Strict checking for mobile phones. 6. Except money donation, no other items are accepted. Thirumala Thirupathi Balaji travels.  Don\\'t ever book in thirumala thirupathi Balaji travels. I am from Chennai and i have a toddler. We booked thirupathi dharshan for 13th of September with 20 days in advance and made payment through online for 3468rs for two persons (Vip dharshan) We called this number 9944650134 to enquire about more details.  A lady picked the call and told we would get cab details on the previous day of the dharshan and disconnected the call. She don\\'t listen you and give full information. She always has the intention to disconnect the call whenever you call her.  On the previous day of the dharshan, we called her again, she told we would get the cab details within 6 pm. But till 7 30 pm, we didn\\'t get the details. When we called that number, that lady told she returned to home and asked us to call this number 9962809053.  We called that number, a guy picked and told he will get back to me in another two minutes, but didn\\'t call back me for 15 minutes. When we tried to call him again, he didn\\'t pick the call, so I called from different number, he immediately picked the call and when i asked the status of the cab details, he was rudely told, he is not responsible and told me to speak to that lady and disconnected the call.  Again when we called that lady, she asked us another 2000rs for cab as the sharing cab was not available. Just think how I would felt in the last minute of the trip to Thirupathi.  So I decided to go to temple on my own and asked her the refund, she told she will deduct 1068 rs for dharshan tickets and will refund only the balance of 2400rs that too will be credited to my account after 7 working days. So I had a dharshan based on the dharshan tickets and chased them for the refund for one month. After so many calls and Chase ups, they returned the money on 16th October. It was a horrible experience with this travels. Tirumala is a the abode of Lord Venkateshwara. This is one of the holiest pilgrimages in South India. With several thousands of visitors daily, the Darshan time is highly monitored. Recently the TTD implemented lanes which make it easier with less pushing or prodding by other devotees. Nonetheless visiting the Lord is still one of the best experiences for anyone regardless of how little time we spend in front of him. It is never enough. Be prepared to push and shove your way through the temple. But when one finally stand in front of the deity and see the splendour of the Lord, everything is forgotten. I visit #TTD it\\'s really amazing place. But I saw notice boards and name boards in Telugu English Hindi and Tamil ,,, why not there in Kannada?? Karnataka people also visited more in Tirupati and they get confusions ... So please provide in Kannada language also,,,,it\\'s my and all kannadigas request,,,plz plz it\\'s more helpful to Karnataka people With such a huge crowd visiting every day, the place was managed perfectly and great to visit. All the areas people, clean, basic needs are managed. Extremely satisfied with the management maintaining the temple. Thanks Excellent Darshan and waiting time was less than 2 hours. TTD provided Lunch and Milk for children. . Please dont visit tirupathi !!! Full Money minded \\' from my childhood i visited around 60-80 times . Pray from your home\\' Worst Experience i had this September 2019 , We started around 10 am to visit the temple ,we had stopped & blocked in godown @ 10.45 am we had lunch, milk , dinner then we got a message in display (TV) opening by next day 10 pm My father 75 years old my mother 69 kids 7 & 2 then i started shouting around 9 pm finally they opened the door @ 10:30 pm half of the crowd came out without seeing lord perumal .  2 days we cant wait in godown , People come to visit only to see lord perumal but these people will give free kalyana katta free Breakfast lunch dinner but Rs.300 for token . Please visit your home town temple and please dont visit tirupathi !!! Travel from Chalakudy, Kerala to Tirupati. Travel in Sabari Express, start at 12.45pm and reached destination at 1am next day Stay at Harita Apartments, Tirupati per day rental 2200INR for two bedroom, booked through booking.com Tirupati railway station to Apartments autorickshaw charged 100INR though it was very close to railway station. Our trip was last minute planned and couldn\\'t book temple visit in advance. So we chose to take FREE temple visit tokens available in bus stand. Tickets will be distributed from 4am, but queue will start early morning and we were in queue by 2.30am. Adhaar card is required for taking tickets and person itself has to stand in queue to get token. We got timing of 10am. We refreshed at our apartment and took an auto again to bus stand (50INR) at 8.30am. From bus stand we took to and fro ticket to Thirumala(100INR). And took a bus. Bus went through security points and reached a bus stand at Thirumala by 10.15am. From there we have to take FREE BUS to temple area. We reached temple area by 10.30am. We showed our token and they let us in. We rushed through the walking area and reached a point where we have to pay for ladoos at the counter, for 12 ladoos 210 INR. For free token, there is no free ladoo. From there we get milk and we have options to keep our luggage in counter. No mobiles are allowed from this area. As we left our luggage, chappals, mobile etc in our apartment, We continued our walk after this point. You find security check point again and then after more walk you reach a point where you get food. Take food, drink water, use toilet etc and you can wait in the waiting area there. Once that gate is ready to open,for us around 2pm, you can continue your walk. We got dharshan around 2.30pm and moved to get our ladoos collected and then towards exit. Bus will be available close to exit area towards Thirupati. The temple is excellent just one thing I would suggest to authorities to please make separate ques for ladies and gents rest everything is good Tirumala abode of lord Venkateswara, swayambhu. Darshan even for seconds take us to immense enthusiasm. Immediately we feel for next darshan. Place with pushkarini, varahaswamy temple, papavinasanam, srivari padalu, akasa ganga, venugopala swamy temple, jabali theertham locating Anjaneya swamy Temple. Ananda nilayam, the holiest place where Swamy is located, entry is everybody\\'s wish. Govinda Govinda... it is something which one gets to hear as soon as we enter the Tirumala massive premises. We went in 300rs darshan line. Its better to prebook your visit as the crowd is maddening there. Dont forget to carry your UID along for verification. No mobiles, camera etc are allowed. Dress code of dhoti shirt for males and salwar kurti/ saree for females are strictly followed. One can buy dhoti from ther if not carried along. Darshan lines are pretty hectic and one can get fatigued easily due to long queues. DO carry water bottles along as no means of purchase later. There is only one gate for entry and exit in the main temple. they manage the pushing crowd really well. One need to take careof kids and elderly well to avoid fall/ stampede. You get to have Balaji darshan only for max 10secs and before you bow u will be pulled out. So do keep your eyes wide open to look into the Garbha grah and take darshan for which all the efforts. Prasadam is wat you get post darshan on both the side of the lines- ladoo and curd rice. Have both they taste amazing. One can donate money in Srivari Hundi which u get while exiting. Please do have ladoos its unique to taste. Govinda Givinda This place is always flooded with people still very beautifully managed . Clean and very organized. They feed to all who want to have food for free and almost most of the hrs .all are accommodated and every one gets darahan and prasad .they handle about a lakh people on an average and they keep improving the infrastructure to make it more and more people friendly.  TTD which is one of the richest temple should invest in Tirupati town infra , especially closed drainage This temple is one of the 51 Pethastan of Devi Uma. Small but very good atmosphere maintained. In front of temple a lake full of fish and tortoise are there. One should must go in their life time, what a peace what a vibration, it is simply mind boggling experience This is not really a tour spot or a Place where you think that you could spend your time leisurely..  This is really a place where thousands of people Come daily to have Darshan of Lord venkateswara and get their minds relieved from worries..  You could see the TTD board doing continous improvements in the Tirumala hill for the comfort of the people Coming here for Darshan.. Amazing place and worthy,clean environment.God give to us a invisible and unmeasured poweror strength to overcome the problems in our life by visiting only I visited in Sept 2018 with my family, without any reservation / VIP ticket. We visited sriniwas to get the tickets and got the Sarvdarshan ticket for same day at 9:00PM. we reached at 8:00Pm and Got entry at 8:20PM. We are lucky that there are not much people and we get clear and good darshan in 2 hours and specd 1 hour for parsad. We get free in 3 hours. We are lucky to good and fast darsharn. Please note that for avoid rush / crowd: 1. Try to go in week day rather then weekend 2. Do not carry anything with you (mobile / bag) as this will save time to deposit at counter. Keep it in Cab / hotel Only 3. Man can wear Pant-shirt / Kurta payjama /Dhoti and women can wear Saari & Suit. 4. Try to go for Night darshan 5.Take SarvDarshan Ticket in place free-pass. Sarv Darshan is again Free given you on the basis of Adhaar Card. Idol of venkateshwara swamy is that not made by humans it is the god himself in the form of idol ,God of wealth and prosperity. The temple is accessible by walk, bus and cars. Lot of facilities available at the hill shrine. Relatively well maintained for a place this busy. Almost round the clock \"anna danam\" to feed the devotees. Lord\\'s darshan is the ultimate divine bliss. The laddu prasadam is unique and heavenly. The timings need to be increased to cater to the ever growing crowd of devotees. The Tirumala Temple located in Tirupathi, Chitoor district, Andhra Pradesh is one of its kind of temple with marvelous Architecture all around. The Divine vibration will fill the body and soul making us feel the presence of divinity there. The pleasent atmosphere on the hills will attract any peace lover and make them feel delightedly happy. Apart from it\\'s visual beauty, it give a sense of supernatural presence, making it undoubtedly the most famous and highly visited Hindu temple in the world. It\\'s one among the \\'must to visit\\' list of every Hindu devotee. The immense happiness on visiting the temple can never be expressed by words by any human. Only the soul can feel it. There won\\'t be a person who would be satisfied on a single visit. Everyone who goes there will leave the place with a strong hope of visiting it atleast one again. One travels several miles to reach Tirupati, walk several miles and reach Tirumala, wait several hours in the queue and the moment of truth happens. 10 Seconds or 20 seconds if you are lucky. The Lord himself appears in front of you, a Gigantic murthy, pulling you like a magnet, making you shout \\'Govinda Govinda\\' - accomplished, your pushed out, slight drops of happy tears, take a circle around the Vimana and pray to Vimana Venkateswara, get prasadam, come out of the temple and sit and start thinking, is this a dream, comes back to your home and totally forgets the face of Lord Venkateswara, wanting you to book for the next travel. Had nice darshan after 5 hours been in the queue and waiting hall. Had delicious sambar rice and hot milk while in the waiting hall. Overall fantastic trip Today\\'s Tirupati pilgrimage trip was good, But while coming back, after requesting for so many times alsoto stop the bus for toilet, the driver didn\\'t stop the bus for urgent toilet requirement,this is not acceptable, Request to improve on the same. Thank You In August 2019 we suddenly decided to visit Tirumala for a Darshan. Whilst myself & my wife (both in our early 60s) are regularvisitors, our daughter and family ( 5 year and 7 month infant, respectively) and son in law were visiting from overseas.  I found that the Darshan tickets weren\\'t available on line, the earliest being a month later. One option for my daughter & her family was to opt for the \"NRI\" ( non resident Indian) darshan, for which they ought to have arrived in India less than 30 days ago.  They had decided to climb up the hill with the infant and they were therefore eligible for either \"Divya darshan\" ,which was offered for 8pm as they started the climb at 10 am and reached atop at noon. The other option was \" Darshan for parents of infants below one year\". Thty opted for the latter and finished the Darshan in less than an hour. This was free of cost.  Myself, my wife and our 5 year old grand daughter went for the senior citizen darshan where one of us had to be above 65 years of age. The counter opens at 7 am for issuing darshan tickets for the same day- either for the 10 am, the 2 pm or later slot.  After standing in the queue from 7.30.am, we got our darshan tickets for the 10 am slot. That\\'s for our grand daughter as well. Generally the temple releases 1400 tickets for senior and disabled citizen darshan daily. However twice a month they release 4000 tickets and having known this I had chosen the day accordingly.  The Darshan was pleasant . We were made to wait till 10 am in a separate enclosure where we were served Upma and milk. The queue comprising all senior citizens was opened at 10 am sharp and we entered the main temple just below the overbridge. We could complete the Darshan in an hour.  This was also a free darshan and we had to just pay Rs 70 for 4 laddus.  The arrangements for both darshan were impeccably made by the temple authorities and for us, this short planned trip turned out to be memorable. Also a word of praise for TTDs help line- this multi lingual, 24/7 help line provided inputs that enabled us to plan well. The only discordant note was when they said we couldn\\'t take our 5 year old grand child in the senior darshan queue- we were allowed to do so.  A marvelous visit to the holy, ultra clean temple town cleansed our mind and refreshed our spirits!! We booked our ticket online. Nri can buy their ticket on the same date. We have to line for 2 hours for darshan only. No puja system which is very good. My favorite temple in the world.Every year i am going with my wife and daughter.Temple inside lord venkateshwara is there.Its the most powerful god in the world.It is the richest god in the world turn over wise.It is located in Tirupathi state is called Andhra pradesh. once we visited in temple we will get peace.. High spirited and amazing experience- when you reach the end of the temple for darshan. The moment of truth right in front of the Lord cannot be expressed in words. Must travel with prior bookings, packaged tour to save time. The laddoo and souvenirs are a must buy while returning. We Visited July 2019. NRI have to carry original passport with visa page. We reported at the counter around 11.00AM. People who fall under defense category, TTD volunteers, and people with infants had formed queues. NRI were made into a queue by around 11.30am. 12.00 clock the queue started to move. The passport was checked and we were allowed to enter ticket issue building. Below 12 years of age the darshan cost is free. Else it is INR 300 per person. We paid money in this building our passport was again verified and we proceeded further to join the darshan queu. When our passport was verified it was around 1.00pm. At each point we saw people joining into our queue from various points. Like people who did some special Pooja can also join, sheegra darshan people join . Our darshan got over around 2.45pm. However to come out of the temple was the greatest rush . We get free ladoo token after darshan. And this ladoo has to be collected from another complex. Please carry your own covers. Covers can be also purchased from the ladoo complex. However there is time to be spend only to purchase covers and then separate queu to collect the ladoos. Altogether our darshan process that day took 3.5 hours to 4 hours. Please wear Dhotis or saree or Churidar with duppata as per the TTD guidelines. Very nice place on the top of the Saptagiri Mountains. With people having lot of faith in the Lord Balaji Always beware while travelling to the temple. Taxi, as well as auto-rickshaw Drivers, are very crooked and their only aim is to ‘loot’ you. Always bargain and fix the taxi fare prior to your travel. The temple is located on a mountain away from the Tirupati town. Taxi Drivers bargain fare from Airport to Town and to Temple differently. I recommend to take a Toyota Innova car if you have a family members of 5 or more for comfortable travel to the top of the temple. Keep the sane taxi and Driver for your come back as well. Or else you may need to bargain with another Looting Taxi or Jeep Driver after you offer prayers. Airport Taxi offers one day Taxi about 5000/-₹ per day rate. A strong suggestion for the temple visitors is always book a ‘special Darshan’ by paying 300/- ₹ per head to avoid the long hours (7 to 8 hours) queue to shorter 2 hours queue. Be fresh to stay in queue, carry enough 2 bottles of water with you to avoid dehydration. Book a taxi from your place of stay to visit the temple. Leave your foot wears, digital watches, cameras, mobile phones, etc at your hotel. These are not permitted inside the temple. Alcohol bottles, beers, cigarettes, etc are also not permitted. If anyone wish to drive your own car, please be aware of the Security check of yourselves, vehicles and baggage. If you get caught, they will ban your vehicles’ entry and ask you to take taxi or Bus to go to the Temple. Dress code for ladies is saree or decent Churidar. Men shall wear white dothi and decent shirt. May lord Balaji bless you... Have been going on this pilgrimage since the last 45 years. The place has changed over the years but for the better. The facilities for pilgrims have increased manifold. The queue management has been streamlined by online booking & could finish my Darshan in 90 minutes end to end. The only regret is that the glimpse of the deity is from afar. Understandably due to the heavy rush.. Tirumala is a divine place where Lord Balaji gives blessings to all the pilgrims who come to worship him. Its worth a visit and excellently managed place with proper Bus facilities, numerous different room types facilities, a lot of free food options within the temple premises and paid restaurants in the nearby vicinity. The main Gabhara (area or place where Lord Balaji resides) of the temple doesn\\'t have any electric light & it\\'s beautifully lighted with Diyas. Its has a large open space where over 1 lack pilgrims seek the blessings of Lord Balaji per day & during festivals, the count increases more than 3 times. There are 2 types of darshan options, one is getting Rs. 300 special entry Darshan where the darshan gets in around 2-3 hours waiting in the line. Another line is free darshan line which ranges between 6-24 hours of waiting. As it is said to be one of the \\'Jagrut Devasthan\\', there are lot of people who believe in Lord Balaji and it is said that if you go to Lord Balaji with a clean heart and true intentions, he listens to your prayer.  To conclude with, I had probably one of the best time spending hours in Tirumala and seek his blessings & its worth the wait.  Om Namo Venkateshay Namah Even on a special entry- it took good 4 hours to get two moments (literally) in front of Govinda. The light inside sanctum sanctorum is so little that by the time your eyes adjust to see anything, you are pushed out. Amazing to see and experience the faith of the masses. We were able to come out in 4-5 hours and people said you are very lucky. We met people from all over India in one place. A great melting pot. Overall once of a lifetime experience. Worth visiting. Excellent Pilgrimage place, Very Sacred and Powerful Place on the earth. Accommodation, Food facilities arranged by Temple authorities are Extrodinarily good and cannot be compared with any other systems. Hygiene maintained is beyond imagination. tirumala temple is located in tirupati.the temple is located in high mountain .where the osm climate. Real holi place In India,provide Huygenian food preparation and always treat as guest.keep distance from unauthorized priests or agents. Pedestrians keep in mint 3550/steps use free leguage service(its very safety and comfortable).I am not suggested jeep sightseeing trip in thirumala(they will make urgency) r.s. 55/ charging bus service much more better.in thirupathy city I got best food from sri lakshmi narayana bhavan.definitely everyone like here food. Despite million visits every month, temple maintains good hygiene standards. There is scope for enhancing devotees experience by providing extra seconds to pray before the great deity. Please dont go there without special entrance ticket.  On 28th July 2019, we reached Tirumala at around 4pm. I planned this trip 3 weeks before and I arranged everything except special entrance ticket (which was not available at that time). Since we havent got any special entrance ticket, we went through free dharshan entrance. Queue started at around 8.30pm and I thought that they might put us in compartment for few hours and I was like okay since I had no choice. But the problem started at the entrance of the queue itself. We were standing in that line for more than 4 hours (before reaching the compartments), around few hundreds returned back since they were unable to stand for a long time. Its completely fine if they put us in compartments, but standing in a queue for 4 hours is not at all acceptable. Total time took around 10 hrs. What kind of management is this? Even they have millions and billions of money, why they were unable to manage properly? We are all humans here and you (ttd) should not do like this. And I noticed one thing when I was coming out after darshan, which is VIP entrance. They stopped the normal queue for more than an hour because of some VIPs. It looks like they are stopping queues in between at some interval for VIP to have quick darshan and thats the whole reason behind this waiting time everyday.  So please dont go there without a special entry ticket (Rs.300) and if the tickets are not available at the time of booking, better go with apsrtc or irctc or any other package. If you still dont find any tickets, try to reach early (around 6am or 7am) in the morning and get time slot sarva darshan ticket which is a free ticket but time based. You can avoid standing in queue before compartments.  Thanks! I would like to share my Tirupati experience so that others visiting in near future gets a benefit. This can answer many questions which one can have in mind before planning their visit. 1. We had booked Special Entry Darshan tickets online at TTD website 2 months prior to our visit. Ours was 11 AM slot on Saturday. People suggest avoiding weekends and public holidays to avoid major rush 2. We stayed in Tirupati where we got a good hotel with comfortable stay and good restaurant 3. On the day of arrival we visited Govindrajswami temple in the heart of Tirupati. We had to go through a quite a long queue here also. 4. Next morning we started for Tirumala by cab in the morning at 8:20 AM. We reached at the top at 9:20 AM. We were following the traditional dress code. Kurta pajama and Salvar kurta with Dupatta. 5. The driver dropped us at the parking near Varaha Swami temple 6. We then visited Pushkarini Tirtham and Varaha Swami temple and returned back to the car 7. The driver then dropped us near Special Darshan Entry gates. We left our footwear and mobile phones in the car, to avoid the queues at the locker and save time. I just had a small sling bag to keep money and some biscuits. We also had a water bottle. You can carry a purse but it is difficult the manage in queue. 8. We had to walk for 5 mins to the entry point where our tickets were checked and we were allowed to enter. It was 9:45 AM. The people from time slots later than 11 AM had to wait outside 9. We then passed through a security check. Our tickets and ID proofs were checked here. Then we were asked to get lined up in a small queue. I guess only few of us were allowed to join the queue. People coming later were asked to wait in the waiting halls where there were chairs to seat. 10. Our queue was quickly got merged with the Sarvadarshan queue. And then started a big rush. People do not believe in queue discipline there. Everyone tries to push and go ahead of you and there is no one to control this queue. This is a wide queue so queue discipline is not maintained by default. There is no place to seat in this queue. 11. Initially the queue was slowly moving but then it stopped completely for some time. Then again it started moving slowly. After passing through several halls and a staircase, we entered the main temple complex. 12. And finally we reached the temple entrance. Where the large golden pillar is there. Once you reach there, means you are very near to the actual deity. 13. Then the queue was broken into multiple parallel queues. And now finally you can see the deity. It is dark inside so you really need to focus to get the darshan. You get a chance for darshan only for 4-5 seconds so do not waste the opportunity in looking somewhere else otherwise in no time you will be out and miss the opportunity. We were outside the temple at 11:05 AM 14. Once you come outside you will find directions to go to the laddu counter where you can get your laddus. You have to walk a few meters bare footed to go till the laddu counter. So if you are in a group, few people can choose to wait instead of everyone going to the laddu counter. 15. 300/- ticket includes 2 laddus for each person. You can also buy extra laddus online at the time of ticket booking or you have to buy a laddu coupon again standing in the queue. You need a bag or container to keep the laddus, so better to keep one clean bag with you to avoid the second queue for buying laddu covers. And then you have to stand in a third queue to get the laddus, after showing your ticket or a coupon 16. Getting into the queue or waiting inside the waiting hall and the waiting time required is all depend upon various factors, like number of pilgrims visiting that particular day, your darshan slot, etc. Also, the darshan schedules vary depending upon the day of the week you are visiting, so I cannot comment on how much time it will take for you but we were lucky to get the darshan in 1.5 hrs. People say that it takes at least 3 hours for special entry darshan. We required total 3 hours at Tirumala. 17. We returned back the Tirupati and then visited the Padmavati temple and our Tirupati yatra was complete. We arrived at Renigunta station on 13 th July 2019 12.30 pm took an auto to Tirupati 250 rupees  Stayed at Adhithi Residency hotel.its nearby the bus stand.very neat and clean. Good hotels to eat nearby  Same day we hired a auto had darshan of Padmavati at 4 pm and went to kapila theertham.  Next day 14th morning 7am started to walk towards Tirumala. It took 5 hours for us to finish. First 1.5 hours are difficult as there are only steps. Afterwards it becomes little easier. Had lunch at Hotel Sarangi. We had booked online for 4 pm darshan. Started by 2.45 pm in the line. Finished darshan and came out by 4.30 pm It took one more hour to collect the laddus and our baggage. Took a shared jeep for down.  Next day visited Kalahasthi by bus. Left for Renigunta It was a nice trip.  But nowadays they don\\'t have enough lights or for some reason they are not switching on the electric lights inside the Sanctum sanctorum.garbagruham Peaceful place & Line to darshan even the special darshan take 3hrs was too hard and the root to darshan was very conjusted & Que management was not proper in some area it was too hard to move & there was no sitting space between the line to darshan in this 3 hrs. Had a nice time. Most of the things are organised. Do eat prasadam. Had a wonderful time with family. I was blessed to witness the supreme from a very close distance.  We reached suprabhata seva Q line by 12am itself but we were late by some 60 people.  At 2 am we are allowed inside, you have to wait now and then in the Q, but you will be allowed in the temple at the right time.  There are about 200 people get to attend the seva, along with some VIPs if present. We all have to stand in the Jaya Vijaya hall, that means first Hall itself.  The seva start with gopalak lighting the panju(path light) the priesthood open the door and enters with panju along with the water in pots for his bath.  Along with us, the shaivars starts suprabhatam. This continues in the Hall. Inside the rituals of srivaari will be going on.  Once suprabhatam is over, one by one we all are allowed till the sanctum to witness the supreme in very near.  After darshan you will 2 srivaari laddu prasaadam at the outside laddu prasaadam counter. For the believers the place is divine.. the long wait in the ques for a few seconds of darshan is well worth it.. the arrangements are very good with facilities provided at every crucial place.. try and take a Rs 300 darshan ticket for a faster experience.. On one of the Tuesdays in February, decided to go to Tirumala. I took the bus from Majestic at 5 pm and reached Tirupathi by 10.30 pm. Stayed in a nice lodge close to the bus stand for 1.1k, an ac room with tv, wifi. Woke up on the next day at around 4.30am and took an autorickshaw to Srivari Metlu(Lord\\'s stairs). This place is around 20kms from Tirupathi. Reached the start point of the ghat road to Tirumala by 5.45 am. They open the ghat road only at 5.45-6 am as leopards may attack devotees in dark. The trek has nearly 2400 steps. At 1100 steps, there\\'ll be a biometric pass issued for darshan. There will be one more check after 2000 steps. Once you reach Tirumala, volunteers serve hot milk and prasadams. I reached by 8 am but many take only 1.30 hours. Had darshan at 11 am and came down to Tirupathi by 12.30pm. Went to Padmavathi temple and took the bus to Bangalore at 3pm. The trick is to go before the exam time starts on a weekday to beat the rush and have a peaceful darshan. Excellent management of the shrine board or whosoever is managing it. If in case a family is not getting an entry ticket in advance so please choose a walking route from another side of the mountain. This way tickets can be arranged on the spot. Be cautious around in case of a heart patient or elderly person. I was here after 1 hour flight from Bangalore and also had VIP pass, still it took more than 3+ hours to enter temple where idol resides inside shrine in temple sanctum. You only get glimpse of lord just for few seconds and that\\'s it all pain and hustle went off after darshan of lord, and no doubt the place is highly spiritual and full of energy which you can feel it and makes it special. Tirumala temple is one of the most famous temples in all over world, which draws large crowd through out the year. Pilgrim must book online pass to visit this temple. Lord Balaji famous and well known temple is located at Tirumala near Tirupati. One of the famous worship temple in South for Hindus is Tirumala Balaji Temple. It is really wonderful experience worth visit in any season. South people regularly visiting this template. Because they believe that, their prayers are successful in their lives. one must visit this temple without fail. the kind of arrangements done by management is really superb. there is no single mosquito on the hills.really great The december time not a big cloud .I HINK DECEMBER1-20 no big rush.No GOVT. holidys that time sinior citizen visit the temple. When you are going up to the temple by ghat road you cannot help thinking who has built this temple - god or man? Because in those days how did anybody carry all the tools and material up the hill. The statue itself inspires godliness and wakes up the goodness in you. Really worth seeing once in a lifetime. If you have strength and energy see it quite often. The place is awesome and has a great religious value. The darshan at the temple were very special and auspicious. I dont think TTD can do anything more about crowd control...devotees should respect the Q and not try to take short cuts...especially telugu ppl..I got a feeling they felt they deserve to go past the crowd coz its in their state ...i saw so many of them fighting with each other and also others..I may be wrong coz I have had a long association with telugu ppl and they are generally soft spoken and very sweet but not the crowd i met there in express darshan.... Most efficiently run and profitable business. Idol worshipping of Hindus has been converted to an unmatchable business where the advertisers are the customers themselves. So with minimal expense you have maximum sales. Wow. 👌 If i reach tirupati on 23/06/2019 sunday ;7 am. Can i get darshan before 10 pm on the same day??plz help Me alongwith my mother, wife and two daughters are visited Shree Balaji Temple in first week of June’19. Language is a barrier in counters and this place. After that the first gate comes when devotees need to go down through few staircases & after lots of up & downs disciples reached just behind the main temple where one more security check they need to pass. Just crossing these security windows devotees will reach just beside main temple. People will entire inside an unbelievable over congested queues segregated by steel pipes (3 / 4 numbers of queues) where devotees are pushing, pulling each other’s unnecessary and no one (means no security / volunteer) managing properly. Starting from this place to darshan is overcrowded, over congested and very badly managed by temple volunteers. Presence of police personnel is very few in numbers. I haven’t seen them to manage the queues inside or outside the temple. The entrance of main temple starts & the main pandemonium starts. Half of the darshan entrance queues are not having barricades or fencing for control the darshan crowd, chaotic situation for the old aged devotees, child’s. My mother & my younger daughter stopped this place by their own due to messy situation. However, me, my wife and my elder daughter continued with the crowed and reached in the main temple after a long struggle in this unmanaged situation. We succeeded a darshan of Shree Balaji for around 4 to 5 seconds only but the darshan was good and peaceful. Our journey started in chennai. We were told that the total trip cost would be 12000. The duration of darshan was told that it will take 45 minutes - VIP darshan. We specifically confirmed whether is it a normal 300 rupees darshan or a VIP darshan. But they said it is a VIP darshan only and it will surely take 45 minutes of only and a guide will be there for you throughout. But they cheated us, the guide came till the entry of Rs.300 darshan and said he will meet after darshan. The darshan almost took 4 hours and 15 minutes. If they would have said it would take this much time we would have prepared atleast. We were carrying a child and it was crying for food. Adults somehow could adjust but how could a child adjust. Since they said it is a fast darshan, we took elders, who felt really stressed out because of the darshan. And after coming out we were made to wait for the vehicle because of the miscommunication between the guide and driver. Then we thought we can have lunch somewhere nearby but they said for lunch we have to go to downhill(keezh) tirupati. We said we are gonna have lunch up only and finished and came. But the driver where forcing us to come fast. Then we came to downhill and continued our journey back. While going the driver told us that if the trip lasted more than 10pm to reach home, we have to pay extra money. It is never about the money, so we paid but it is the stress they made us to suffer. So please while choosing this trip via the AP tourism, Plan accordingly even if they tell all sort of lies. in advance online booking govinda govinda few seconds long wait senior citizens crowd management darshan tickets guest house by foot andhra pradesh early morning religious place visit this place queue india              Blessed to be there Best experience for every time 👏👏👏👏 Amazing Rich temple but poorly organized and difficult to navigate Kaliyuga daivam Darshan and crowd Peaceful visit early in the morning... when luck and a bit of planning are on your side God Darshan is being Hijacked by the Management Bad experience Great Govinda Govinda Vaikuntam of bhulokh.
